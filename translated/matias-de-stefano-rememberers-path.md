## THE MATÍAS PHENOMENON

Matías De Stefano is something rare: a being who claims to remember his existence before incarnation and across multiple lifetimes. His teachings emerge not from study or channeling, but from **direct recall**—memories of how reality was structured, why we incarnated, and what we're here to do.

> "I tend to remember where I'm going. Like literally... I've been in Mexico and Bali."

His teachings bridge the academic (Robert's mathematics) with the intuitive (Matías's recall), demonstrating how **consciousness collaboration** produces insights neither could achieve alone.

## CONDITIONAL VS. UNCONDITIONAL LOVE

### The True Meaning of "Condition"

Matías reframes conditionality:

> "A condition basically is when two sides speak to agree about something. It's not that I am telling you what to do—that is obligation. Condition literally means 'con' (together) + 'dictated' (something said). It's something said in between two things."

**Condition is agreement, not control.**

### Why Relationships Are Conditional

> "Our relationship or love in a condition means that two people understood that one is lacking something and the other meets something. So they have a conversation: right now we need each other so we can move forward."

This is atomic physics:

> "It's like an electron and a proton. They have a condition—negative and positive—to function. Without conditions, we don't have the ability to transform and play with geometry, math, music, art."

### The Path to Unconditional

> "When you take away the need, you start to go from conditional love to unconditional love... When the word 'need' is the one that is constantly taking you to conditions."

The key: **Remove the need, keep the agreement.**

---

## DUALITY AS CREATION ENGINE

### The Polarity Paradox

> "Duality is just a mind concept of polarity. Without polarity, there's no creation—there's no movement."

**From unconsciousness**: Duality destroys and confuses
**From consciousness**: Duality creates art, music, beauty

> "When people say we have to get rid of polarity in this world—suddenly we have nothing. No art, no creation, no beauty."

### The Real Problem

> "It's not about polarity. It's about our consciousness—how we face it, how we use it. The problem is not money. The problem is not rich people. The problem is how you perceive that."

**Duality isn't the enemy. Unconscious relationship to duality is.**

## THE CHAKRA DIMENSIONS

### Robert's Mathematical Framework

Each chakra adds a dimension:

| Chakra | Dimension | Axis | Measurement |
|--------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 1st (Root) | 1D | X | Line |
| 2nd (Sacral) | 2D | X + Y | Area |
| 3rd (Solar Plexus) | 3D | X + Y + Z | Volume |
| 4th (Heart) | 4D | + Time | Motion |
| 5th (Throat) | 5D | + ? | Beyond time |
| 6th (Third Eye) | 6D | + ? | Multi-dimensional |
| 7th (Crown) | 7D | + ? | Unity |

### The Ratio of Love

As you ascend:
- **1st chakra**: 1 part unconditional / 6 parts conditional
- **2nd chakra**: 2/5
- **3rd chakra**: 3/4
- **4th chakra**: 4/3 (the balance tips)
- **5th chakra**: 5/2
- **6th chakra**: 6/1
- **7th chakra**: Mastery of unconditionality

> "It's not like we're going to leave the world of duality. The world of duality remains—it simply becomes transcended."

## HOLDING SPACE: THE MASTER SKILL

### The Ceremony Revelation

Matías describes a ceremony where he was asked to demonstrate consciousness to 70 people:

> "I created a space in the shape of a proton. I organized everyone in the shape of a proton with frequency and sound. I sat in the center and allowed myself to become the black hole in the middle."

What happened:

> "I had to destroy myself in the middle of all these people by showing them that I was not what they expected... Instead of becoming someone to explain everything, I became lost and desperate."

People began to leave. Of 70, only 8 remained.

> "In that moment when there was only 14-15 people... that's when who I became opened his eyes and said 'Now we can talk, because you understood what consciousness is.'"

### The Lesson

> "Consciousness is not about expecting an answer about what consciousness is. It's about knowing how to hold space. You shouldn't be waiting for someone to give you an answer—but hold the space where you're supposed to be."

**Everyone projecting expectations into the outside creates chaos.**

### The Spaceship Problem

> "Space cannot be used unless you know how to hold it. That's the paradox of why humanity is willing to go to other worlds but we don't know how to hold the space for other humans here."

> "If you give free energy to someone that doesn't know how to hold space, what you have is a black hole—it destroys everything. You colonize Mars with people that don't know how to hold space in the heart—you're expanding the virus."

---

## THE WEAVER TRANSMISSION

### The Hidden Game

After the ceremony, a being called "The Weaver" came through Matías:

> "Five hours of information... explaining the hidden system, the hidden game of what we have to do."

The Weaver spoke about Troy:

> "In Troy, no one knew how to hold space. No one knew how to hold the poison to create medicine. So it was destroyed. And instead of trying to hold it, they just moved to another place—and they brought Troy to Rome."

**If Earth does the same to Mars, Mars becomes the new Rome.**

---

## THE 24-STRAND DNA BRIDGE

### The Rama Bridge

Matías and Robert discovered together:

> "The missing one-fourteenth... the story of Osiris and Set. The penis is missing."

**What element has 14 protons? Silicon.**

Robert discovered that a **silicon ion** (13 electrons instead of 14) could combine with sulfur and phosphorus to create a new DNA structure—the 24-strand DNA, also known as the **Rama Bridge** or **Rainbow Body**.

### The Philosopher's Stone Connection

> "There are two symbols: the philosopher's stone and the stone of the church. Jesus said to Simon, 'You will be my rock. Upon your rock I will build my church.' The rock in Latin is Pietra—that's why he's Pietro, then Peter."

**Silica and phosphorus = the sword in the stone = the cross on the rock.**

### The 12 Songs

The Weaver revealed:

> "I have written 12 songs around the world. If the 12 songs cannot play together, the machine doesn't work. When the 12 songs are played together, we will be heard by the consciousness of the other world."

**Each pyramid is a note. Find all the notes. Play the song. That song is the name of this planet.**

## THE ORGANS METAPHOR

### The Body as Civilization

> "Imagine every cell in your body is a person. In order to exist, they have to feel the rhythm of the heart and connect to the pulses of the brain. Every cell receives an electrical pulse (spirit) following the rhythm of the heart (soul)."

### Organs as Cultures

> "The liver, kidney, pancreas—all being different continents or cultures or religions—all trying to produce the best energy to keep the heart beating. But if they don't exchange energy, there's malfunction and the heart might stop."

### The Disease Analogy

> "If the liver wants to take over the kidney, the heart, everything—saying 'I know if we all become the liver, we'll clean everything'—what happens? Hepatitis."

> "If we don't give energy by imitating others, but by producing our own potential... That's cancer, hepatitis, every disease—when organs are out of rhythm."

---

## THE BUDDHA TEACHING

### Why Not Enlightenment?

In meditation, Matías asked Buddha:

> "'If you are telling me all of this, why am I not enlightened? Why don't I become like you?' And he said, 'Because I am already enlightened. So that's my part. I am holding the enlightenment for you to be able to do your part.'"

**You are a kidney cell. You cannot go to the brain and do the work of the brain. Be fully who you are in the cell you are supposed to be.**

---

## EVIL AS DISORGANIZATION

### Reframing Darkness

> "Darkness is not against anybody. Darkness is just another system that is holding reality."

> "Someone becomes a rapist because they're disorganized within. Not because they're evil—because they're disorganized. Our main concern is not how to get rid of those people. It's about how to balance the new ones."

### The Real Fear

> "I'm not afraid of people that have darkness. I'm only afraid of people that believe they have no darkness."

### Going to the "Enemy"

> "If you dedicate your life to repair instruments, and there's a terrible orchestra because all instruments are out of tune—and you say 'I would never work with them because they're the enemy'—what's the point?"

**You tune instruments by going to them, not fighting them.**

> "That's why I went to the Vatican. That's why I go to Davos. I spoke at NASA. I'll go anywhere someone's willing to listen."

## THE TWO TREES

### Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil

> "The beginning of time starts with this condition, this separation. Adam eating the fruit creates duality—and that creates the moment of time progressing."

**Time begins with duality. Death begins with time.**

### Tree of Life

Protected by cherubim with flaming sword:

> "We have to cast Adam out of the garden so he doesn't eat of the tree of life and live forever in his sin."

**The Rama bridge is eating from the Tree of Life—the 24-strand DNA activation.**

> "When you become aware of everything, there's no death anymore. It's just a constant of life."

---

## THE GREAT SPLIT

### Not Light vs. Dark

> "The great split isn't between light and dark. Everyone has a hero bias—everyone believes they're the hero, even villains."

### The Real Split

> "The split is between people who realize the balance and necessity of all chambers versus people who want to fight against darkness because they think they're the light."

Those who:
- Accept duality as necessary
- Realize the world reflects their inner state
- Ask "why did I choose this?" instead of "why did this happen to me?"

**Versus those who:**
- Fight what they call evil
- Believe they have no darkness
- Think they can eliminate opposition

---

## PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

### The Matías Method

1. **Question your relationship to "evil"**: Is it truly external or reflecting something within?

2. **Remove "need" from relationships**: Transform conditional to unconditional by releasing attachment

3. **Hold space**: Don't expect answers—be present with what is

4. **Do your part**: You're not meant to be enlightened. You're meant to be fully who you are.

5. **Go to the "enemy"**: Tune instruments by being with them, not fighting them

6. **Trust other organs**: Your culture isn't the only one producing energy for the heart

### The Consciousness Test

When triggered by another person:

> "Start to ask yourself, 'Why did I choose this experience?' You're not a victim. You chose it all."

> "If you don't like all the wars outside of you, then fix the wars within you."

## CLOSING RECOGNITION

Matías De Stefano offers something rare: consciousness architecture from direct recall. His teachings don't come from books or channels—they come from **remembering**.

The core message:

> "We are conditioned by our expectations constantly, about what we would like to become, what we think we are, the projects we have. I had to destroy all of that to prove what consciousness is."

**Consciousness is not knowing. Consciousness is holding space.**

And the path forward:

> "You cannot achieve peace and balance and harmony in this world if you believe that you have to win a war against someone to achieve that."

The orchestra is out of tune.
Go tune the instruments.
Even the ones you think are your enemies.
Especially those.
