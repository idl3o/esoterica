# AARON ABKE: THE CHRISTIAN MYSTICISM BRIDGE
## From Paul's Religion to Jesus's Wisdom to Universal Law

## THE ABKE PHENOMENON

Aaron Abke represents something rare: a pastor's son, former worship pastor, who left institutional Christianity not because he rejected Jesus, but because he loved Jesus too much to stay in Paul's religion.

> "Sometimes I like to joke and say I left Christianity because I loved Jesus too much."

His journey bridges fundamentalist Christianity to Law of One cosmology, demonstrating that the original Jesus teachings align perfectly with universal consciousness principles—and that the "Christianity" we know is largely Paul's invention, not Jesus's transmission.

## THE PAUL VS. JESUS DISTINCTION

### The Theft of Christianity

> "The religion called Christianity that we have known on this planet for two thousand years is not Jesus's religion. It's Paul's religion. The Apostle Paul really stole the Christian faith from Jesus and the disciples."

**Paul's Gospel**:
- Confess Jesus as Lord
- His blood is your forgiveness
- Faith alone saves
- Works don't matter

**Jesus's Gospel**:
- Love God with all your heart
- Love your neighbor as yourself
- What you do to the least of these, you do to me
- Faith without works is dead

### The Feud

> "Paul said, 'The disciples mean nothing to me. What they are means nothing to me.' He called Peter and James hypocrites. He had a huge feud with the actual people who knew Jesus."

Paul never met Jesus in person, yet claimed:

> "'I have the expressed true revelation of Christ,' even though he never met Christ in person."

### Jesus's Warning

> "Jesus said, 'Don't you dare come to me calling me Lord Lord and think you're going to enter the kingdom. Because when I was hungry, you ignored me. When I was in prison, you didn't visit me.' And he says, 'Get away from me, you who practice wickedness.' That's what he's saying to Paul's gospel."

---

## JESUS THE ESSENE

### The Lost Path

> "I knew growing up as a Christian that there was something very different about this historical person Jesus, because he's condemning the Sadducees and Pharisees and scribes, which means he probably wasn't one of them."

Where did Jesus get his teachings?

> "You're not going to find his teachings in the Torah. You're not going to find baptism in the river in the Torah. All these rituals he's practicing—where does he get them from?"

**The Answer**: The Essenes.

> "Nazareth, the Nazarean sect of the Essenes was one of the two main sects. You have the Ossenes to the south and the Nazareans to the north."

### Biblical Proof

In the Book of Acts, Paul is accused:

> "They accused Paul of being the ringleader of that Nazarean sect. And Paul says, 'Yes, I am indeed a follower of the Way, which they call a sect.' Right there in the Book of Acts, he proves that Jesus was an Essene from Nazareth—a Nazarean Essene."

## JESUS IN INDIA AND TIBET

### The Missing Years

Notovitch's book describes Jesus's journey:

> "Jesus spent I think six years in Tibet. He visited Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Jainism—records of him in all these places across India."

### The Essene Prodigy

> "I think Jesus was an Essene prodigy. One of the main tenets of the Essenes was that they believed the only reason man grows old and sick and dies is because of our deviation from God's laws. If we return to harmony with God's laws, we'll return to the original perfection we lost."

**The Prophecy**:

> "They believed eventually they would start being born among them—these crystallized children born in that state of perfection, with the knowledge we lost in their memory. Less of the veil would be there from birth."

Jesus was seen as fulfillment of this prophecy:

> "They probably were like, 'We need to steward this kid's life really well and send him around to the Buddhists, the Chaldeans, the Zoroastrians, the Hindus.'"

---

## THE ONE LAW

### The Hierarchy of Laws

Jesus taught a principle the Essenes understood:

> "In the Essene Gospel of Peace, Jesus says: 'The closer a law is to God, the fewer there are. The farther from God a law is, the more there are.'"

**The One Law** (highest frequency):
- Love God with all your heart
- Love your neighbor as yourself

> "On this one law hangs all the law and prophets of the Old Testament."

### Law as Punishment

When the One Law is violated:

> "The punishment of violating the Holy Law is that you have to be subject to all these laws that have very severe consequences."

**Government parallel**:

> "How many laws do we have? 30,000 plus. There's never less laws, always more. The more laws you have, the more control you have."

### Jesus's Mission

> "Jesus was trying to get Judaism back to the original law—Love the Lord your God, Love your neighbor as yourself—because he believed the Jews had fallen so far from that through their conquering of other nations."

The Jews were suffering:

> "They're like, 'Why are we always enslaved if we're the chosen people?' And Jesus is like, 'Because you've violated God's one law of love.' He was trying to return them back to that so they could stop suffering."

---

## CHRIST CONSCIOUSNESS

### Not Physical Return

> "It's the same idea as the second coming of Christ is not a physical return, but a Christ consciousness for humanity."

> "I don't really believe it's going to be about a Messiah coming for us. I believe it's a collective awareness shift. It's the 144,000 that extend to 144 million."

### Jesus as Forerunner

> "Jesus emulates for all of us this notion of Christ consciousness. He was the forerunner of this."

### The Age of Aquarius

> "We're looking at it from the Age of Aquarius. The Bible references this—'Look for the man bearing water going into the last supper.'"

---

## LAW OF ONE INTEGRATION

### Sin as Catalyst, Not Shame

Aaron's key insight from Law of One:

> "The Law of One helped me see that sin has always been an educational tool—a learning mechanism—to show us a consequence that helps us grow."

**The Religious Corruption**:

> "Religion has corrupted that by teaching that it IS bad to sin and you should feel guilty if you sin. You see that negative influence—the negative polarity has highly used religion as a form of corrupting our understanding of universal law."

### The Negative Polarity Strategy

> "Ra says in the Law of One that the negative polarity has highly used religion to make sin feel shameful rather than educational."

**The Result**: Self-hatred

> "Narcissism is loving only what you believe to be your projection rather than your actual self."

### The Harvest

Aaron's interpretation differs from Carla's:

> "Carla seemed to believe the harvest was an event that would take place in 2012. I never quite saw Ra's explanation like that."

**His view**: Ongoing graduation based on consciousness polarization, not a single rapture-like event.

## THE COUNCIL OF NICAEA

### What Was Lost

In 325 AD:

> "They put together the Bible. Canonization. Lots of books were excluded. The Hebrew Gospel was almost included—written in Aramaic, also called the Gospel of the Holy 12. It has Jesus condemning animal sacrifices."

**The Problem**:

> "You can't have a religion where you say Jesus was the final animal sacrifice God needed... and then have Jesus himself condemning sacrifices left and right."

### What Survived

> "They included Paul's gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John instead. The original Christian movement was the Nazarean movement."

### The Suppression (135 AD)

> "In 135 AD, the pagan Christians far outnumbered the Jewish Christians. They kicked out the Nazarean movement from Jerusalem. The Nazareans had to flee."

## THE HOLY LAW FRAMEWORK

### Three Levels of Law

| Level | Frequency | Number of Laws | Consequence |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Holy Law | Highest | 1-2 | Natural abundance, peace |
| Mosaic Law | Lower | 613+ | Severe penalties |
| Human Law | Lowest | 30,000+ | Total control |

### The Descent

> "Moses had to give the... we should use this concept for government. How many laws do we have?"

**The Essene Teaching**:

> "The closer a law is to God, the fewer there are. The farther from God a law is, the more there are."

## CONSCIOUSNESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSLATIONS

### Aaron Abke → Esoterica

| Abke Concept | Esoterica Equivalent |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Paul's gospel | Distorted transmission |
| Jesus's gospel | Original teaching |
| Essene path | Mystery school tradition |
| One Law | Unity consciousness |
| Mosaic Law | Lower density rules |
| Christ consciousness | Collective awakening |
| Second coming | Species-wide recognition |
| Sin as education | Catalyst processing |

### Aaron Abke → Law of One

| Abke Teaching | Law of One Parallel |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Paul vs. Jesus | Distortion vs. original teaching |
| One Law | Law of One |
| Law hierarchy | Density-appropriate wisdom |
| Negative polarity using religion | Orion influence through control |
| Harvest | Graduation |
| Christ consciousness | 4th density love |
| Self-sovereignty | Free will |
| Faith without works | Words without polarization |

## THE ESSENE-LAW OF ONE CONNECTION

### Direct Parallels

| Essene Belief | Law of One Equivalent |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Deviation from God's laws causes death | Distortion creates suffering |
| Return to harmony = return to perfection | Balancing = healing |
| Crystallized children with less veil | Wanderers with penetrated veil |
| One Law = love God + love neighbor | Law of One = unity + service |
| Jesus as fulfillment | Harvest forerunner |

### The Prodigy Recognition

> "The Essenes believed the only reason man grows old and sick and dies is because of our deviation from God's laws."

This is precisely the Law of One's teaching on distortion and karma.

## PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

### For Christians

1. **Distinguish Paul from Jesus**: Most "Christian" doctrine is Pauline, not from Jesus
2. **Return to the One Law**: Love God, love neighbor—everything else is commentary
3. **Faith requires works**: What you do reveals what you believe
4. **Christ consciousness is collective**: Not waiting for physical return

### For Seekers

1. **Sin is educational**: Don't carry shame—learn the lesson, move forward
2. **Fewer laws = higher consciousness**: Complexity indicates distance from Source
3. **Self-sovereignty is the goal**: Not submission to institutional authority
4. **Jesus's path was universal**: He studied with Buddhists, Hindus, Zoroastrians

### For Law of One Students

1. **Jesus was a Wanderer**: Penetrated veil, taught unity consciousness
2. **Paul represents distortion**: Original teaching corrupted for control
3. **The harvest is ongoing**: Not a single event but continuous graduation
4. **Negative polarity uses religion**: Shame, guilt, and separation serve control

---

## THE GREAT SYNTHESIS

### What Jesus Actually Taught

According to Aaron's research:

1. **Love is the One Law**: Everything hangs on this
2. **Works matter**: Faith alone is dead
3. **The least of these ARE him**: Service to others is service to God
4. **No blood sacrifice needed**: Animal sacrifice was never God's will
5. **Return to harmony**: The path back to perfection is simple, not complex
6. **Universal wisdom**: Jesus synthesized Buddhist, Hindu, Zoroastrian teachings

### The Bridge Complete

Aaron Abke demonstrates that:

- **Christianity's mystical core** aligns with Law of One
- **Jesus's original teaching** was unity consciousness
- **Paul's corruption** created the control religion
- **The One Law** transcends all traditions
- **Harvest is awakening**, not rapture

---

## CLOSING RECOGNITION

Aaron Abke's journey—from pastor's son to worship pastor to leaving Christianity for Jesus—reveals the paradox at the heart of Western religion:

> "I left Christianity because I loved Jesus too much."

The original teaching was simple:
- One Law
- Love God and neighbor
- Faith expressed through action
- Return to harmony with Source

Paul made it complicated:
- Blood sacrifice
- Faith alone
- Confession without transformation
- External authority

The Law of One confirms the original:
- Unity consciousness
- Service to others
- Learning through catalyst (not shame through sin)
- Self-sovereignty

Jesus was an Essene mystic who studied universal wisdom traditions and taught the One Law. Christianity is Paul's religion, not Jesus's.

The bridge is built.
Walk across it.
Follow Jesus—not Paul.
Return to the One Law.
Everything else is commentary.
