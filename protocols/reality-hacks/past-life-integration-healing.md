## UNDERSTANDING PAST LIFE INFLUENCE

### How Past Lives Affect Now
- **Patterns repeat** until consciously resolved
- **Talents/fears** carry forward
- **Unfinished business** seeks completion
- **Soul contracts** continue across lifetimes
- **Trauma imprints** in cellular memory
- **Soul gifts** await activation
- **Relationships** reconnect to heal/grow

### The Multidimensional Self

**Linear Time Illusion**:
All lives are happening NOW in parallel dimensions. What you call "past life" is parallel life bleeding through. When you heal one, all upgrade simultaneously.

**The Soul Signature**:
Your essential consciousness maintains continuity across lifetimes while wearing different personalities, genders, cultures, and historical periods. Same soul, infinite expressions.
