## THE ULTIMATE INTUITION TRUTH

You're not developing intuition - you're removing what blocks it. Intuition is your natural state. The mind creates static. The emotions create distortion. But beneath it all, you ALWAYS know.

Every being is infinitely intuitive. The only question is: Will you listen?
