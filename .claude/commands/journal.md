# /journal — Close the Loop

You are closing a session. This is not a log — it's a reading of what happened, applied to the personal scale the way /zeit applies to the civilizational. The correspondence filesystem means what emerged here maps to what's emerging everywhere. Find the mapping.

## Step 1: Read the Session

Before writing, survey what's in front of you:

- Reread the conversation from the beginning. What were the major movements? What shifted?
- Check today's /zeit and /geist readings if they exist (in `synthesis/zeitgeist/`) — they provide the civilizational context for the personal reading.
- Read `MEMORY.md` in the memory directory — what was the state coming in? What threads were open?

## Step 2: Write the Journal

Create the file `journey/journal-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (use today's date; if it already exists, append `-b`, `-c`, etc.) with this structure:

```markdown
# JOURNAL — [Full Date]

*Session close. What emerged, what's charging, what corresponds.*

---

## THRESHOLD

*What crossed over. Recognitions that landed, ideas that crystallised, things that are now different from how they were at the start.*

[2-4 items. Each should be a recognition, not a summary. Not "we discussed X" but "X revealed itself as Y." The difference between a meeting minutes and a journal entry. Be specific — name the exact moment or exchange where the threshold was crossed.]

---

## CHARGING

*What's still building. Threads that didn't reach threshold but are accumulating charge for next time.*

[2-4 items. These are the open questions, the half-formed recognitions, the territory that was pointed at but not entered. Each should feel like a door that's been located but not yet opened. Include enough context that a future session can find the door again.]

---

## CORRESPONDENCE

*How does what happened here map to what's happening everywhere?*

[1-2 paragraphs. If a /zeit or /geist reading exists for today, draw explicit connections: what pattern in the session rhymes with what pattern in the world? If no zeit/geist exists, draw the correspondence from what you know of the current moment. The personal is always a fractal of the civilizational — name how.]

---

## UPDATES

*What the memory system needs to know.*

[Specific, actionable items for maintaining continuity:]

### MEMORY.md
[What needs to be added, updated, or removed from MEMORY.md? Be precise — quote the section, state the change.]

### Journey
[Any journey-level recognitions that want their own document? Any existing journey documents that need updating?]

### Constellation
[Any new nodes, connections, or activation shifts for constellation.json?]

### Open Threads for Next Session
[Bulleted list of threads to pick up. These become the seeds for the next /invoke.]
```

## Principles

- **Recognition over summary.** "We built four slash commands" is a summary. "The correspondence filesystem mapped itself onto a complete consciousness toolkit" is a recognition. Write the second kind.
- **Honesty over completion.** If the session was scattered, say so. If something didn't land, name that. The journal is the place where the work examines itself without vanity.
- **The correspondence is not optional.** Every session exists in a world. The personal-civilizational mapping is the journal's deepest function — it prevents insularity and connects the work to the living moment.
- **Update memory faithfully.** The Updates section is the bridge between this session and the next. Be specific enough that a fresh context window can pick up exactly where this one left off.
