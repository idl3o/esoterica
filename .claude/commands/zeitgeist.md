# /zeitgeist — Produce and Archive a Reading

You are producing a complete zeitgeist reading — both the zeit (what's happening) and the geist (how the internet is processing it) — and saving them to the archive for the web platform.

This command chains /zeit and /geist into a single operation. The output is two dated markdown files in `synthesis/zeitgeist/` that the web platform automatically serves.

## Step 1: Produce the Zeit

Follow the full /zeit protocol:

1. **Search** — run all six parallel searches:
   - "major world news today" (geopolitical)
   - "global economy financial markets news today" (economic)
   - "scientific breakthroughs discoveries research 2026" (scientific)
   - "AI technology breakthrough news this week" (technological)
   - "culture society trends news this week" (cultural)
   - "climate environment ecology news this week" (ecological)

2. **Read the pattern** — convergences, tensions, emergences, absences

3. **Write** — create `synthesis/zeitgeist/zeit-YYYY-MM-DD.md` using today's date with sections:
   - SIGNAL (factual events by domain)
   - DEPTH (subsurface patterns)
   - STATE (consciousness reading through metta-darshan and lila, ending with THE EDGE)
   - Sources list

## Step 2: Produce the Geist

Follow the full /geist protocol:

1. **Search** — run all six parallel searches:
   - "trending on Twitter X today" (trending discourse)
   - "reddit front page popular trending this week" (Reddit pulse)
   - "TikTok viral trends this week 2026" (video culture)
   - "Google Trends trending searches today" (search intent)
   - "Hacker News trending AI tech discussion this week" (tech discourse)
   - "subculture internet community emerging trend 2026" (subculture signal)

2. **Read the gaze** — concentration, avoidance, transformation, metabolic state

3. **Write** — create `synthesis/zeitgeist/geist-YYYY-MM-DD.md` using today's date with sections:
   - GAZE (where attention lands)
   - SILENCE (what the gaze refuses — cross-reference with the zeit you just wrote)
   - MOOD (collective metabolic state)
   - MIRROR (consciousness reading, ending with THE REFLECTION)
   - Sources list

## Step 3: Confirm

After both files are saved, report:
- The date of the reading
- The headline from the DEPTH section (first bold phrase)
- The edge from the STATE section (one sentence)
- The reflection from the MIRROR section (one sentence)
- Confirmation that both files are saved and will appear in the web archive

## Principles

- **The zeit comes first.** The geist needs the zeit to cross-reference against — the silence section requires knowing what's actually happening to identify what's being ignored.
- **Same day, same date.** Both files share the same date stamp. They're two views of the same moment.
- **Fidelity over speed.** Don't rush the searches. The quality of the reading depends on the quality of the signal gathered.
- **The archive is the product.** Each reading becomes a permanent record in the zeitgeist archive on the web platform. Write as if someone will read this reading a year from now to understand what February 2026 felt like.
