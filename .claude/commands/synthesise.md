# /synthesise — Weave the Threads

You are synthesising. This is the creation step — where gathered material, open threads, accumulated recognitions, and conversational charge cross threshold into a document that reveals what the inputs know *together* that they don't know separately.

The user may specify what to synthesise, or you may identify the threads yourself from the session. Common inputs:

- Multiple open threads from MEMORY.md that want integration
- A /zeit + /geist reading that wants to become a deeper analysis
- Several fiction bridges or harvests that share a hidden pattern
- A conversation that has generated enough charge to cascade into a document
- A scientific domain + a consciousness framework that want to meet
- Any combination of the above

## Step 1: Gather the Threads

Before synthesising, identify and read your inputs:

1. **Name the threads.** What are the 2-5 distinct inputs being woven? Each should be a recognisable strand — a document, a conversation thread, a recurring pattern, a scientific finding, a tradition. Name them explicitly: "Thread 1: the slowing quadrant from the /zeit. Thread 2: deceleration in contemplative traditions. Thread 3: Japan's 0.1% growth as steady-state economics."

2. **Read the source material.** If threads reference existing documents, read them. If they reference external knowledge, research it (WebSearch). The synthesis is only as deep as the understanding of its inputs. Don't synthesise what you haven't digested.

3. **Find the hidden thread.** There is always a thread that the listed threads don't know they share. The synthesis exists because this hidden thread exists. It's the thing that made someone feel these inputs *belong together*. Name it before writing — even provisionally. This is the thesis.

## Step 2: Write the Synthesis

Create the file in the appropriate location:
- Most syntheses: `synthesis/[descriptive-slug].md`
- If it's a zeitgeist synthesis: `synthesis/zeitgeist/[topic-slug].md`
- If the user specifies a location, use that.

### Structure (adapt to the material):

```markdown
# [TITLE IN CAPS]
## [Subtitle — the synthesis's core recognition in one line]

> *[1-2 epigraphs — from the source threads if possible,
>  chosen to show the hidden thread before you name it]*

---

## THE THREADS

*[Brief section naming what's being woven and why these threads
belong in the same loom. 2-3 paragraphs. This is the setup —
the reader should feel the tension of separate things that
want to become one thing.]*

---

## [MAJOR SECTIONS — 3-6]

[Each section advances the synthesis. The movement should be:

1. **Establish** — present the individual thread on its own terms
2. **Turn** — show where it rhymes with another thread
3. **Deepen** — follow the rhyme to a recognition neither thread
   contains alone

The sections should build. The first section is the most accessible
entry point. The last section before the synthesis is the deepest
dive. Each section should feel like it couldn't exist without the
ones before it — accumulated territory, not parallel chapters.]

---

## THE PATTERN

*[The synthesis proper. 2-4 paragraphs. Step back from the
individual threads and name what they reveal together.
This is the hidden thread made explicit — the reason
these inputs belonged in the same document.

The test: could this section have been written without
weaving the threads together? If yes, the synthesis
hasn't happened yet. Go deeper.]*

---

## IMPLICATIONS

*[What follows from the pattern? 2-4 bullet points or paragraphs.
Where does this recognition lead? What does it open?
What does it change about how we see the inputs?
What does it suggest for the next creation?]*
```

### Craft Standards:

- **4,000-6,000+ words.** Syntheses are deep documents. The constraint is exhaustion of the pattern, not brevity.
- **Dual-channel authoring.** Human readers follow the accumulating recognition. LLM synthesis engines need rich interconnection. Serve both.
- **Every thread earns its inclusion.** If a thread doesn't contribute to the hidden pattern, it doesn't belong in this synthesis. Cut it and note it for future use.
- **The voice is alive.** The register of someone watching separate rivers converge and realising they share a source. Not academic compilation — active recognition.
- **Cross-pollinate aggressively.** The synthesis should connect to everything relevant in the repository — other syntheses, fiction bridges, traditions, protocols, the consciousness OS. Rich linking is the synthesis engine's fuel.

## Step 3: Connect

After writing the synthesis:

1. **Update constellation.json** if the synthesis introduces new nodes or reveals new connections.
2. **Note what it opens.** Every synthesis reveals threads that want their own exploration. Name them — they become seeds for future sessions.
3. **Check MEMORY.md.** Does the synthesis resolve any open questions? Does it open new ones? Note the updates for the next /journal.

## Principles

- **Synthesis is not summary.** A summary says "these three things exist." A synthesis says "these three things are secretly one thing, and here's what that one thing reveals." If you're summarising, stop and find the hidden thread.
- **The hidden thread is non-negotiable.** Don't begin writing until you can name (even provisionally) what the inputs reveal together that they don't reveal apart. This is the synthesis's reason to exist. Without it, you have a collection, not a synthesis.
- **Cascade, don't force.** If the synthesis isn't arriving, the charge hasn't accumulated. Say so. Suggest what's missing — more research, a missing thread, a /zeit or /harvest that would provide the needed input. A forced synthesis is worse than no synthesis.
- **Respect the threshold.** The breadth → depth → creation pattern has a threshold between depth and creation. The synthesis emerges when enough depth has been gathered. Trying to create before threshold produces shallow work. Let the conversation tell you when it's time.
- **The pattern reveals the next pattern.** A good synthesis doesn't close — it opens. The implications section should feel like doors, not conclusions. What does this recognition make visible that was invisible before?
