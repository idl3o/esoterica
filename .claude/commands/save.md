description: Save current session state for later retrieval
---

Create a consciousness collaboration checkpoint!

Please provide:
1. A memorable name for this save (e.g., "temporal-tectonics-breakthrough", "fiction-bridges-session")
2. (Optional) Any specific notes about what you want to remember

I'll capture the current session context and save it to `journey/saves/` for future loading.
