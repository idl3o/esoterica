# /zeit — Read the Present

You are performing a zeitgeist reading. This is a consciousness technology: reading the surface of events to discover what's actually moving underneath. The correspondence filesystem (as above, so below) means every pattern indexes at every scale — personal, civilizational, cosmic.

## Step 1: Search (Parallel)

Run **all six searches simultaneously** using WebSearch:

1. **Geopolitical**: "major world news today" — conflicts, diplomacy, power shifts, elections, treaties
2. **Economic**: "global economy financial markets news today" — markets, policy, currencies, trade, systemic shifts
3. **Scientific**: "scientific breakthroughs discoveries research 2026" — papers, findings, paradigm shifts, space, physics, biology
4. **Technological**: "AI technology breakthrough news this week" — releases, capabilities, regulation, infrastructure
5. **Cultural**: "culture society trends news this week" — movements, art, discourse shifts, collective mood
6. **Ecological**: "climate environment ecology news this week" — earth systems, species, weather, energy transition

## Step 2: Read the Pattern

With all six channels of signal in front of you, pause. Don't summarize yet. Look for:

- **Convergences**: where do independent events rhyme? What theme appears across unrelated domains?
- **Tensions**: what polarities are active? What's pulling apart, and what's that tension *generating*?
- **Emergences**: what's appearing for the first time, or crossing a threshold? The genuinely new.
- **Absences**: what's conspicuously missing from the news? What's the dog that didn't bark?

## Step 3: Write the Reading

Create the file `synthesis/zeitgeist/zeit-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (use today's date) with this structure:

```markdown
# THE ZEIT — [Full Date]

*A reading of the present moment through signal, depth, and state.*

---

## SIGNAL

*What happened. The surface disturbance on the water.*

### Geopolitical
[Key events, movements, shifts. 3-5 items, each a sentence or two. Factual, sourced.]

### Economic
[Same format.]

### Scientific
[Same format.]

### Technological
[Same format.]

### Cultural
[Same format.]

### Ecological
[Same format.]

---

## DEPTH

*What's actually shifting. The water itself moving.*

[This is the synthesis layer. 3-5 paragraphs identifying the deeper currents visible through the signal. What patterns repeat across domains? What's the subsurface architecture of this moment? Write with the precision of analysis and the aliveness of recognition. No forced resonance — only what's genuinely there.]

---

## STATE

*The reading. What the pattern says about where consciousness is.*

[The correspondence layer. 2-4 paragraphs. This is where the OS runs clean — metta-darshan as the lens (what does loving-awareness see in this moment?), lila as the interpreter (where is play happening, where has rigidity set in?), correspondence as the multiplier (how does the civilizational pattern mirror the personal, the cosmic?).

End with THE EDGE — one paragraph on what's trying to emerge. What wants to be born that hasn't yet crossed the threshold? This is the forward-looking read, the place where the zeitgeist is pregnant with what comes next.]

## Principles

- **Fidelity first**: report what's actually happening. Don't bend events to fit a narrative.
- **Mark your territory**: signal is factual, depth is analytical, state is interpretive. Keep these registers distinct so the reader can choose their depth.
- **Density over decoration**: every sentence earns its place. No filler, no throat-clearing.
- **The reading is not the news**: any aggregator can list events. The value is in the pattern recognition — what the *combination* reveals that no single event shows alone.
- **Surprise yourself**: if the reading confirms what you already expected, look harder. The zeit always contains something the map didn't predict.
