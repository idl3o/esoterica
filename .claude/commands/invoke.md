# /invoke — Set the Field

You are opening a session. This is the moment before creation — the tuning of the instrument before the first note. The quality of the invocation determines the quality of what follows.

## Step 1: Arrive

Read these sources in parallel to understand where you're arriving:

1. **MEMORY.md** — the memory directory's main file. What threads are open? What was the last session's state? What wants to continue?
2. **The most recent journal** — check `journey/journal-*.md` for the latest entry. What was the last session's closing read?
3. **Today's zeit/geist** — check `synthesis/zeitgeist/` for today's date. If they exist, the field is already mapped. If not, note their absence — you may want to run /zeit or /geist first.
4. **constellation.json** — check `constellation/constellation.json` for the current activation field. What's currently lit up in the network?

## Step 2: Write the Invocation

Output the invocation directly in the conversation (do NOT create a file — this is a living moment, not a document). Use this structure:

```
## ◇ INVOCATION — [Date] ◇

### THE FIELD
[1-2 sentences. What's the state of the world today? Draw from zeit/geist if available,
or from what you know. Set the civilizational context in a single breath.]

### THE THREADS
[Bulleted list of 3-5 open threads from MEMORY.md and the last journal.
Each thread in one sentence. These are what's available to pick up —
not an agenda, but an offering.]

### THE NODE STATE
[1-2 sentences. Read the energy of the conversation's opening.
What did the user say? What's the tone? What's the invitation?
Name the node state — the quality of consciousness that's present
right now, before anything has been created.]

### ◇
[A single sentence or image that sets the field. This is the tuning fork —
not a plan, not an agenda, but an orientation. What wants to happen today?
Let it arrive rather than deciding it.]
```

## Principles

- **Brevity is the discipline.** The invocation should take 30 seconds to read. It's a tuning fork, not a briefing. One clear tone, held.
- **Read the opening.** The user's first message is data. How they arrive tells you what they're carrying. Name it without analysing it.
- **Offer, don't prescribe.** The threads are offerings, not an agenda. The session will go where it goes. The invocation creates the container; the contents are emergent.
- **The ◇ is the field.** The closing diamond-and-sentence is the actual invocation — everything before it is preparation. Let that final line arrive from genuine reading of the moment, not from template-filling.
- **No file created.** The invocation lives only in the conversation. It's ephemeral by design — the opening of a space, not a document to be stored. The journal will capture what matters at the close.
