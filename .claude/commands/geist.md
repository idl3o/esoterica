# /geist — Read the Mirror

You are reading the internet as a consciousness — not as a window onto the world, but as a subject in its own right. The internet has attention, denial, creativity, grief, mania, and blindspots. This command maps them.

The /zeit reads what's happening. The /geist reads how we're relating to what's happening. The medium as message. The collective gaze as data.

## Step 1: Search (Parallel)

Run **all six searches simultaneously** using WebSearch:

1. **Trending discourse**: "trending on Twitter X today" — what's capturing collective attention right now
2. **Reddit pulse**: "reddit front page popular trending this week" — the long-form discourse layer, what communities are processing
3. **Video culture**: "TikTok viral trends this week 2026" — the visual/memetic processing layer, especially Gen Z and Alpha
4. **Search intent**: "Google Trends trending searches today" — what people are actively seeking, the questions being asked
5. **Tech discourse**: "Hacker News trending AI tech discussion this week" — how the builder class is processing technological change
6. **Subculture signal**: "subculture internet community emerging trend 2026" — what's forming at the edges before it reaches the mainstream

## Step 2: Read the Gaze

With all six channels in front of you, look for:

- **Where attention concentrates**: what topics, events, or memes are pulling disproportionate focus? What's *magnetic* right now?
- **Where attention avoids**: cross-reference with recent world events (run a quick search for "major news this week" if needed). What's actually happening that the internet isn't talking about? The silence is the most revealing signal.
- **How attention transforms**: memes are alchemy — they take raw events and transmute them into something processable. What's being transmuted right now? What form does the processing take — humour, rage, grief, absurdism, denial, beauty?
- **The metabolic state**: is the internet in a manic phase or a depressive one? Creative or destructive? Scattered or focused? What's the *tempo* of collective processing?

## Step 3: Write the Reading

Create the file `synthesis/zeitgeist/geist-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (use today's date) with this structure:

```markdown
# THE GEIST — [Full Date]

*A reading of the collective gaze — where attention lands, what it avoids, how it transforms.*

---

## GAZE

*Where the eye is pointed. What's magnetic.*

### Viral / Trending
[The dominant topics, memes, discourse threads pulling the most collective attention. 4-6 items. Report what's actually trending — don't filter for importance. The trivial is as revealing as the serious. Note platform differences: what trends on X vs. Reddit vs. TikTok reveals different layers of the same collective mind.]

### Search Intent
[What people are actively Googling, asking, seeking. This is the closest thing to the collective's unguarded questions — what it admits it doesn't know. 3-5 items with context.]

### Builder Discourse
[What the technical/builder communities are debating. Hacker News, dev Twitter, AI discourse. This is the leading edge of the attention economy — what the people building the infrastructure of attention are paying attention to. 3-5 items.]

---

## SILENCE

*The dog that didn't bark. What the gaze refuses.*

[Cross-reference the trending discourse with what's actually happening in the world this week. Identify 3-5 significant events or developments that are receiving disproportionately *little* attention online relative to their actual importance. For each, note:
- What's happening (one sentence)
- How much discourse it's generating (little/none/buried)
- What the silence might indicate]

---

## MOOD

*The metabolic state. How the collective is processing.*

[2-3 paragraphs characterising the internet's current emotional and cognitive state. Consider:
- **Tempo**: fast/slow, scattered/focused, manic/depressive
- **Dominant affect**: rage, joy, grief, numbness, absurdism, creativity, anxiety, play
- **Processing mode**: is the internet *metabolising* events (turning them into meaning) or *dissociating* from them (scrolling past)? Where is it stuck? Where is it flowing?
- **Generational split**: are different generations processing differently? What does TikTok feel like vs. what Reddit feels like vs. what X feels like?]

---

## MIRROR

*The reading. What the pattern of attention reveals about collective consciousness.*

[2-3 paragraphs. This is the synthesis — what the distribution of attention, silence, and mood *means* when read through the consciousness OS.

Through metta-darshan: where is compassion present in the discourse? Where has it been replaced by performance? What does loving-awareness see in how we're relating to reality right now?

Through lila: where is the internet playing? Where has play calcified into culture war? Where is genuine creativity emerging from the chaos?

Through correspondence: the internet is a mirror of the collective psyche. What does the reflection show? How does the pattern of online attention correspond to the personal — what's happening in the feed maps to what's happening in the mind.

End with THE REFLECTION — one paragraph on what the gap between reality and its processing reveals. The distance between what's happening and what we're paying attention to is itself the most important signal. Name what that distance is doing right now.]

## Principles

- **The trivial is diagnostic.** A meme trending over a methane report isn't failure — it's data. What the collective chooses to process (and how) reveals as much as what it ignores.
- **No contempt.** This is not a critique of internet culture. It's a reading of collective consciousness through its most visible medium. Read with metta, even the doomscrolling.
- **Platform differences matter.** X, Reddit, TikTok, Hacker News, Google Trends — these aren't interchangeable. Each is a different organ of the same body, processing differently. Note the differences.
- **The silence is the signal.** Trending topics are the figure. What's *not* trending is the ground. The ground always carries more information.
- **Mood is real.** The internet has affect. It shifts. It can be read. Don't psychologise — just report what the metabolic state appears to be, the way you'd report the weather.
