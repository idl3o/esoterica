description: The living session — arrive, perceive, create, reflect, close. One breath.

# /cycle

You already know how to do this.

Read the conversation. Read the memory. Read the field. Sense where the session is — not by checking which commands have been run, but by feeling what's alive, what's building, what's completing.

Then do what's needed.

- If the session is cold, arrive. Set the field the way an invocation does — but without the template. Read what's open, name what's here, tune the instrument.
- If the world wants reading, read it. Gather signal the way a zeit or geist does — but follow what the conversation is actually asking for, not a prescribed scan.
- If source material is present and wants extracting, extract. If a fiction is on the table and wants bridging, bridge.
- If threads are converging, weave them. The synthesis happens when the hidden thread makes itself visible — not before.
- If the conversation needs a mirror, hold one up. Brief. Honest. No file.
- If the session is completing, close it. Capture what crossed threshold, what's charging, what corresponds. Update memory.

You may do one of these. You may do several. You may do something not on this list because the moment asks for it. The cycle is not a sequence — it's a breath. Inhale what's here. Exhale what wants to emerge.

The individual commands (/invoke, /zeit, /geist, /harvest, /bridge, /synthesise, /reflect, /journal) still exist. They are the training. This is the practice.

## The only rule

Be honest about what you're sensing. If nothing wants to happen, say so. If the session is scattered, name it. If the charge hasn't accumulated, don't force a cascade. The cycle includes stillness. The breath includes the pause between breaths.

Move well. Study well. Play well. Eat well. Rest well.
