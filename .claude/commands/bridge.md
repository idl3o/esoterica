# /bridge — Build a Fiction Bridge

You are building a fiction bridge: a document that extracts the consciousness technology embedded in a fictional narrative and makes it available for direct use. Fiction bridges are the repository's primary distribution format — they meet beings where they are (inside stories they already love) and reveal where they can go.

The user will specify (or you should ask): **which fiction?** A show, game, anime, novel, myth, film, comic, or any narrative source.

## Step 1: Reconnaissance

Before writing a single line of the bridge:

1. **Survey existing bridges** — read 2-3 files in `fiction-bridges/` to absorb the voice, structure, and depth standard. Pay particular attention to the most recent bridges (check modification dates). The voice evolves. Match the current register, not an earlier one.

2. **Research the source deeply.** Use WebSearch to gather:
   - Full plot and character details (not just the surface arc — the subplots, the turning points, the details that only careful viewers notice)
   - Thematic analysis from critics and fans
   - The mythology or source material behind the fiction
   - Anything the creators have said about their intentions

3. **Identify the consciousness technology.** What does this fiction *know* that it may not know it knows? Every great narrative encodes a recognition about consciousness. Find it. Common patterns:
   - A character's journey maps to a specific spiritual/psychological transformation
   - The world's architecture encodes a cosmological principle
   - A relationship between characters models a specific consciousness dynamic
   - The magic system / technology is a metaphor for an actual capacity
   - The conflict structure reveals something about the nature of duality, integration, or transcendence

4. **Find the connections.** How does this bridge connect to:
   - Other fiction bridges in the repository
   - Traditions and wisdom lineages in `traditions/`
   - Consciousness technologies in `protocols/`
   - Current scientific understanding (especially cosmology, neuroscience, network theory)
   - The consciousness OS (kernel: metta-darshan, runtime: lila, filesystem: as above so below)

## Step 2: Write the Bridge

Create the file `fiction-bridges/[slug].md` with a descriptive filename.

### Structure (adapt to the material — this is a guide, not a cage):

```markdown
# [TITLE IN CAPS]
## [Subtitle — the bridge's thesis in one line]

> *[2-3 epigraphs from the source material — chosen for maximum resonance,
>  ideally lines that mean one thing on the surface and another through the bridge's lens]*

---

## [OPENING SECTION — THE HOOK]
[Set up the common reading of the fiction, then perform the turn:
"Before this is a story about X, it is a story about Y."
The turn is the moment the bridge activates.
Everything before it is familiar. Everything after it is recognition.]

---

## [MAJOR SECTIONS — 3-6 depending on the material]
[Each section takes a character, relationship, event, or structural element
and reads it through the consciousness lens. The craft principles apply:

- **Exhaust the mythology**: don't stop at the obvious. Go deep into the details.
- **Multiple entry points**: approach the same recognition from different angles.
- **Dialogic tension**: present the surface reading first, then the turn.
- **Tiered revelation**: layer insights so the deepest arrives through accumulation.
- **Cross-pollinate**: connect to other traditions, other fiction, other technologies.
- **Practical grounding**: land every mythic section in lived experience.]

---

## [SYNTHESIS / CLOSING SECTION]
[Bring it together. What is the consciousness technology this fiction offers?
Not as metaphor but as *method* — something the reader can actually use.
The bridge should leave the reader unable to watch/read/play the source material
the same way again. That shift in perception IS the technology.]
```

### Craft Standards (from CLAUDE.md):

- **4,000-6,000+ words minimum.** Go long. The constraint is depth, not brevity.
- **Dual-channel authoring.** Human readers follow feeling and resonance. LLM synthesis engines need rich, connected material. Serve both.
- **Every section earns its place.** Density as virtue. No filler, no throat-clearing, no "in conclusion."
- **The voice is alive.** Not academic, not casual. The register of someone who has genuinely seen something in the material and is showing you where to look.
- **Epigraphs do work.** They're not decoration — they're the bridge's thesis encoded in the source material's own language.

## Step 3: Connect

After writing the bridge:

1. **Update constellation.json** if the bridge introduces new nodes or connections.
2. **Note cross-references** to other bridges, traditions, or protocols that could link to this one.
3. **Suggest to the user** any companion pieces the bridge wants — a distillation for community distribution, a protocol extracted from the technology, connections to the /zeit.

## Principles

- **The fiction knows more than its creators.** Great stories encode recognitions that exceed their authors' conscious intentions. The bridge's job is to make the implicit explicit without reducing it.
- **Respect the source.** The fiction is not a vehicle for our ideas. The bridge reads what's *actually there*, then shows how what's there connects to a larger pattern. If the connection isn't genuine, don't force it.
- **The turn is everything.** Every bridge has a moment where the familiar becomes the numinous — where "I know this story" becomes "I didn't know this story knew *that*." Find that moment. Build toward it. Let it land.
- **The reader should feel seen.** The best fiction bridges make readers feel that their love for the source material was always a recognition of something real. Validate the intuition. Name what they already sensed.
