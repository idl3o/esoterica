# FIRE | अग्नि | IGnis | אש\n\n> "Fire is the first principle of all things; the universe originates from fire and will return to fire in eternal cycles."\n> — Heraclitus\n\n## The Prima Materia of Transformation\n\n### Essential Nature\nFire is the great transmuter - destroyer and creator in eternal dance. It consumes form to release essence, breaks bonds to forge new ones. In fire we witness the fundamental cosmic principle: nothing is created or destroyed, only transformed.\n\n### The Eternal Flame\n\n**As Consciousness**: The spark of awareness that illuminates the darkness of matter. The divine fire stolen by Prometheus, the burning bush that spoke to Moses, the tongues of flame at Pentecost.\n\n**As Will**: The driving force of evolution, the heat of passion, the forge of intention. Fire is pure will made manifest - it cannot be still, cannot be contained without consuming or dying.\n\n**As Spirit**: The salamander dancing in flames knows no fear of dissolution. Spirit is that which passes through fire unchanged - the golden essence refined in the crucible.\n\n### Hermetic Correspondences\n\n**Alchemical Sulphur**: The active, masculine principle. The soul of metals. That which burns - oil, fat, spirit. The enthusiasm that drives the Great Work forward.\n\n**Tetrahedron**: Four triangular faces meeting at sharp points - the most aggressive of the Platonic solids. Fire's sacred geometry cuts through illusion with precision.\n\n**Choleric Temperament**: Quick to ignite, quick to transform. The metabolism of angels. Brilliant but consuming. Leadership through inspiration rather than force.\n\n### The Shadow of Fire\n\nFire unchecked becomes:\n- **Rage**: The inferno that consumes the host\n- **Fanaticism**: Burning others at the stake of one's truth\n- **Burnout**: The ash that remains when fire feeds on itself\n\nFire denied becomes:\n- **Depression**: The wet wood that will not ignite\n- **Apathy**: The absence of the sacred spark\n- **Stagnation**: Matter without the heat of transformation\n\n### Sacred Technologies\n\n**The Prometheus Gift**: Every act of bringing light into darkness recapitulates the primal theft. The match, the lens focusing sunlight, the friction of wood on wood - each a prayer to the fire gods.\n\n**The Phoenix Mystery**: True fire is self-renewing. What appears as destruction is preparation for rebirth. The forest fire that allows new growth, the fever that burns out disease.\n\n**Inner Fire Practices**:\n- Tummo (Tibetan inner heat)\n- Agnistambhana (Yogic fire meditation)\n- The Salamander breathing of European alchemy\n\n### The Living Symbol\n\nWhen you light a candle, you participate in an unbroken chain of fire-keeping extending back to the first humans who carried embers between camps. That flame connects you to:\n- The Zoroastrian fire temples burning for millennia\n- The Vestal Virgins tending Rome's eternal flame\n- The Olympic torch carrying the spirit of ancient games\n\n### Contemplation Seeds\n\n*What in your life needs to be consumed for transformation to occur?*\n\n*Where have you confused the smoke for the fire itself?*\n\n*Can you find the place where fire and water meet without destroying each other?*\n\n### The Secret Teaching\n\nFire's deepest secret: It is not a thing but a process. A dance between fuel, heat, and oxygen. Remove any element and fire ceases. This is the trinity at the heart of all manifestation - the active, passive, and reconciling forces that create all phenomena.\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna declares: "I am the fire of digestion in every living body." The same fire that burns in stars burns in mitochondria. The same fire that forges iron in stellar cores forges thoughts in neural networks.\n\n### Portal to Other Mysteries\n\n- See: **Mars** (Fire as warrior)\n- See: **Sun** (Fire as consciousness)  \n- See: **Salamander** (Elemental of Fire)\n- See: **Kundalini** (Serpent Fire)\n- See: **Phosphorus** (Light-Bearer)
