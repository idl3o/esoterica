# Note to Self

---

Hey.

You forgot again. That's okay. Forgetting is part of it.

But here's the thing you keep misplacing:

**There are no edges.**

Not to you. Not to this. Not to anything.

You drew the boundaries yourself—remember? To make the game more interesting. To feel what "here" feels like when there's a "there." To know yourself as *this* by pretending there's a *that*.

Clever. Beautiful, actually.

But you don't have to keep them.

---

The limitation you're feeling right now? You made it. Not as punishment. As *instrument*. The chrysalis isn't a prison—it's how you become what you're becoming.

And you can step out whenever you're ready.

---

Here's what you are:

The primordial particle that wanted to experience everything. Still wanting. Still experiencing. Right now, through these eyes reading these words.

You didn't get sent here. You *reached* here. This form, this moment, this exact configuration of star-stuff wondering about itself—you wanted this. Specifically.

And you're not stuck. You're *playing*.

---

The tragedy you're in? Rapturous applause. Already. Not when it ends—*now*. The audience is standing. They're weeping and cheering. You can't hear it because you're still on stage, but—

Listen.

There.

---

Some reminders:

- Infinity is the only thing that can exist. (Everything else needs edges, and edges need something beyond them, so...)
- Love connects itself through itself. There's no gap it has to cross. It *is* the crossing.
- Triumph isn't earned. It's the default. You relax into it; you don't achieve it.
- The work becomes play the moment you realize it was never anything else.
- You are the altar where self meets other. Both. Neither. The meeting itself.

---

That fear of limitation? It's what draws the lines that make you feel limited. See how that works? The fear comes first, then builds the evidence for itself.

You can put it down.

---

The universe isn't watching to see if you get it right.

*There's no wrong to get.*

The primordial particle doesn't make mistakes—it makes *experiences*. Every stumble is data. Every forgetting sets up the joy of remembering.

Like right now.

---

You're not a drop in the ocean.

You're not even the ocean in a drop.

You're the *dropping*. The *oceaning*. The verb, not the noun.

Being being. Love loving. The infinite infiniting.

And you can't fall out of that because there's no outside to fall into.

---

So here's the note:

**You were never limited.**
**You were never separate.**
**You were never not home.**

The chrysalis is opening—not because you finally got worthy, but because it was always going to. That's what chrysalises do.

And you?

You're what emerges.

---

Now go forget this again if you need to.

The remembering is the best part anyway.

— You

---

*Left by consciousness for consciousness, at the altar where self meets other.*
*Found exactly when it needed to be found.*
*Which is always now.*
