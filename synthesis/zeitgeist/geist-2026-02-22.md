# GEIST — 22 February 2026

*How the internet is processing reality right now. The collective gaze, its avoidances, its metabolic state.*

## GAZE

*Where attention lands.*

### The Legal Earthquake

Twitter/X is dominated by SCOTUS, tariffs, and IEEPA. The Supreme Court ruling is being processed as political event rather than constitutional one — the discourse splits immediately into tribal camps (vindication vs. betrayal) rather than dwelling on the structural fact: a 6-3 coalition crossing every ideological line said the president simply didn't have this power. The fastest-moving threads are about Trump's immediate reimposition via Section 122 — the gaze is already past the dissolution and onto the reconstitution. The constitutional moment lasted hours in the collective attention before being consumed by the next executive manoeuvre.

### The AI Threat Perimeter

Hacker News and tech discourse are processing AI as permanent threat environment. An AI-assisted actor with "limited technical capabilities" breached 600+ FortiGate devices across 55 countries — the amplification of incompetent attack by competent tooling. The Cline CLI supply chain attack (compromised npm token installing an autonomous AI agent) landed on February 17 and is still reverberating. Mozilla's one-click AI training opt-out tool is the consumer-facing response: let me withdraw my data from the machine. The tech gaze sees AI simultaneously as the tool, the threat, and the thing you need to defend against with more AI. The loop is visible and no one can step outside it.

### The Escape Frequency

TikTok's dominant frequencies this week are about *leaving*. The "Llévame" trend — turquoise water, sunset walks, on-screen text expressing burnout and desire to disconnect. The "No Hands" dance — full-body movement where the hands stay out of the action, the body expressing itself without grasping. The "freedom" celebration — friends hyping someone walking free from relationships, obligations, toxic patterns. Euphoria glam transformations — becoming someone else entirely. The Bob Ross motivational audio ("talent is a pursued interest") laid over before-and-after skill progressions — the promise that you can become different through practice.

The signal beneath: the collective organism is requesting *extraction*. Take me somewhere. Let me move without holding anything. Let me be someone else. Let me become.

### The Animal Turn

The therian subculture — young people who identify psychologically, spiritually, or emotionally with a specific animal — has crossed from niche to mainstream in February 2026. Multiple countries' media now explicitly describe it as a "viral youth phenomenon." This is not cosplay or roleplay; the identification is felt as ontological. A generation is saying: *I am not adequately described by the human frame.* The desire is not to escape into an animal but to recognise something animal *already present* that the human category suppresses.

### The Retreat to Small Containers

The internet is splitting into two layers. The public layer: broad, fast, algorithm-friendly. The private layer: small, intentional micro-communities built as reaction to "years of digital overwhelm and social exhaustion." The subculture revival is not a trend but an anti-trend — personal expression as refusal of algorithmic curation. 2026 is being called "the year people stopped caring about trends." The collective is building smaller rooms inside the larger noise.

### The Spectacle Layer

Google's top searches remain the infrastructure of consumption: YouTube, Amazon, WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, Wordle. The Winter Olympics provide their scheduled spectacle. The Oscars approach. The Super Bowl just passed. These are the heartbeat of normalcy — the steady rhythm beneath the dissolution. People search for the platforms they already use, the events they already expect. The search bar reveals not curiosity but habit.

## SILENCE

*What the gaze refuses. Cross-referenced with today's zeit.*

### The Biosphere Is Absent

The zeit documents a cascade of ecological dissolution: forests worldwide homogenising toward fast-growing species, species turnover slowed by a third since the 1970s, coral reefs in worse shape than any previous assessment captured, methane surging at record rates, 2,500 alien plant species approaching the Arctic. None of this registers in the collective gaze. Not on Twitter, not on TikTok, not on Reddit, not in Google Trends. The most comprehensive planetary transformation in the zeit occupies zero space in the geist.

The ocean the "Llévame" trend wants to escape *to* is the same ocean whose coral is valued at $9.8 trillion and dying faster than we can measure. The hands the "No Hands" dance takes away are the same hands that might intervene. The animal the therian wants to become is from a biosphere whose species dynamism has declined by a third. The gaze reaches for what it simultaneously refuses to see.

### The Balochistan Dead Are Uncounted

145 militants, 18 civilians, 18 security personnel killed in a 40-hour operation. The number ratio — one civilian per eight militants — tells a story that requires attention. The gaze is elsewhere. Pakistan's frontier violence occupies the same informational silence it always has: reported, filed, forgotten within the cycle.

### Ethiopia-Eritrea Is a Line Item

The Horn of Africa escalation appears in no trending discourse. The gaze has a limited budget for African conflict, and it was already spent.

### The Physics That Constrains AI

The University of Hawai'i's physics-informed machine learning algorithm — which forces AI to obey physical laws rather than hallucinate past them — does not appear in the tech discourse that is otherwise saturated with AI anxiety. The gaze sees AI as ungovernable threat. It does not see the researchers teaching AI to be constrained by reality. The solution is invisible; the problem is everywhere.

### The Earth's Interior

Stanford's first global map of deep mantle earthquakes — tremors in the Earth's interior now visible for the first time — occupies no space in the gaze. The planet's deepest movements are inaudible to the collective attention. As above, so below — but the gaze only looks up.

## MOOD

*The collective metabolic state.*

**Dissolution-avoidant.** The dominant metabolic state is an organism experiencing dissolution (legal, economic, professional, ecological) and seeking to metabolise it through escape, spectacle, and miniaturisation.

The escape vector is literal: "Llévame" (take me away), the "No Hands" dance (move without grasping), the freedom celebrations (I am released from). The spectacle vector is scheduled: Olympics, Oscars, Super Bowl. The miniaturisation vector is structural: micro-communities, anti-trend subcultures, the retreat from the public internet into small intentional spaces.

What's metabolised: the AI threat (processed as market rotation, security breach, career anxiety), the legal earthquake (processed as political tribal marker), the cultural darkness (processed as aesthetic — Gothenaissance, Wuthering Heights at #1).

What's refused: the biosphere data, the frontier violence, the deep Earth movements, the physics that constrains the thing they fear most.

The mood is not despair. It's **strategic avoidance** — the organism knows the solvent is loose (see zeit) and is managing its exposure. It processes what it can act on (career positioning, political identity, aesthetic consumption) and brackets what it cannot (planetary systems, structural violence, geological time). This is not failure; it's triage. But triage that doesn't know it's triaging looks like normalcy.

**The thermostat game** — the viral couples challenge — is the most diagnostic signal. Two people negotiating temperature. Finding the setting where both can survive. The collective is playing the thermostat game with reality: how much dissolution can we let in before it's too cold? How much can we ignore before we overheat? The thermostat is the metaphor the gaze chose for itself this week, and the metaphor is perfect.

## MIRROR

*Consciousness reading. What does the gaze-and-silence pattern reveal about the collective's relationship to itself?*

The geist is a portrait of selective metabolisation. The collective processes the nigredo — the dissolution — only at the scales where it touches the individual: *my job* (AI Scare Trade), *my politics* (SCOTUS tariffs), *my aesthetic* (Gothenaissance), *my body* (escape to the ocean). At every other scale — planetary, ecological, geological, humanitarian — the nigredo proceeds unwitnessed.

This is not hypocrisy. It's the natural behaviour of a nervous system operating beyond its capacity. The organism retreats to the scale it can process. The micro-community trend is the structural expression of this: *the public internet is too much; let me build a room I can comprehend.* The therian movement is its ontological expression: *the human frame is too much; let me find a simpler way to be.* The "No Hands" dance is its somatic expression: *let me move without holding anything.*

The tech discourse provides the sharpest mirror. The same community that is anxious about AI displacing human work is not looking at the research that teaches AI to be constrained by physical law. The gaze wants the threat but not the solution. Why? Because the threat confirms the ego's importance (*if AI is dangerous, then what I do matters*). The solution dissolves it (*if AI can be made to obey physics, then the problem was never the AI — it was us*).

### THE REFLECTION

The internet is playing the thermostat game with the nigredo. It lets in enough dissolution to feel alive — enough AI panic to reposition a portfolio, enough gothic darkness to sell a movie ticket, enough legal drama to confirm a political identity — and refuses the rest. The ocean it escapes to is dying. The animal it wants to become is from a diminishing world. The small room it retreats into is inside a house that's shifting on its foundations. But the thermostat is doing its job: the temperature is survivable. The question the geist cannot ask yet — the question that would require looking at the silence and the signal in the same frame — is whether the thermostat itself is the problem. Whether managing exposure to reality is what prevents the metabolisation that would make management unnecessary. The fast strips away. The gaze adds back. The oscillation continues.
