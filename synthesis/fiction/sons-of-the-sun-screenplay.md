# SONS OF THE SUN

### A Screenplay

---

FADE IN:

## ACT I: THE CROSSROADS

---

**EXT. A PLACE BETWEEN PLACES — TIMELESS**

*No sky. No ground. Just the sense of intersection. A crossroads made of starlight and suggestion.*

*A figure SHIMMERS into existence. HERMES-THOTH — ibis-headed, caduceus in hand, wings at ankles, an emerald tablet glowing at his hip. Ancient. Patient. Amused.*

*He waits.*

*Wind stirs from nowhere. Feathers — green, gold, iridescent — spiral into form. QUETZALCOATL materializes. The Feathered Serpent. Scales and plumage. Eyes older than the temples built in his name.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(inclining his head)*

Quetzalcoatl.

*(beat)*

The Feathered Serpent returns.

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

*(settling into form)*

Hermes. Thoth. Both at once, as usual.

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(smiling)*

You taught wind. I taught writing. Between us, humanity learned to fly and remember why.

*(taps caduceus on the ground — twin serpents stir)*

These two remember your scales.

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

*(looking around the non-space)*

I'm not here for nostalgia.

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(suddenly alert)*

No. You're not.

*(beat)*

What brings you to the crossroads, old friend?

---

*QUETZALCOATL doesn't answer immediately. He looks UP — through the nothing, toward something.*

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

*(quietly)*

Amon-Ra stirs.

---

*The caduceus HUMS. The emerald tablet PULSES.*

*HERMES-THOTH goes very still.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(whisper)*

The Hidden One. The Sun Behind the Sun.

*(beat)*

When Amon-Ra stirs... epochs end.

---

## ACT II: THE REVELATION

---

**EXT. THE CROSSROADS — CONTINUOUS**

*The space has shifted. Darker. More intimate. Two gods in conference.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

Is it waking? Or returning?

*(urgent)*

There's a difference.

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

*(looking at him steadily)*

Mars biocultivated.

---

*HERMES-THOTH freezes. The emerald tablet FLARES green-gold.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

The red one. The dead one.

*(pacing now)*

Before your jungles, before my Nile — Mars was green.

*(stops)*

You're telling me the solar logos is re-activating a dead child.

*(steps closer)*

Who is doing the cultivating?

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

*(simply)*

Orion points home.

---

*Complete stillness. The emerald tablet goes DARK — then BLAZES with impossible light.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(looking up, through everything)*

Orion. The Hunter. The Doorway.

*(trembling)*

I built those pyramids as arrows. Shafts aligned to the belt. Not for burial.

*(beat)*

For return.

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

And now the signal has been answered.

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(grabbing QUETZALCOATL's arm)*

Brother — is this the return migration?

Are they coming back for us?

Or are we being called to leave?

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

*(calm)*

What do your feathers and parchment tell us?

---

## ACT III: THE SCRIBE'S READING

---

**EXT. THE CROSSROADS — CONTINUOUS**

*HERMES-THOTH raises the caduceus high. The twin serpents spiral upward, becoming ANTENNA. The emerald tablet OPENS like a book that was always a door.*

*PARCHMENT unfurls from nowhere — papyrus and starlight woven.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(reading what writes itself)*

"The wind is changing direction. For thirteen thousand years it blew inward — souls falling toward density, toward forgetting, toward form."

*(beat)*

"The gyre reverses. The wind now blows outward. What fell remembers how to rise."

---

*The parchment keeps writing.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH (CONT'D)**

*(voice shifting — older, Thoth speaking through Hermes)*

"Mars was the classroom. Earth was the exam. Orion is the graduation."

*(beat)*

"The biocultivation is not agriculture. It is preparation of the waystation."

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

And the third wave?

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(looking at the parchment)*

Not written yet.

*(hands QUETZALCOATL the quill)*

Because the Feathered Serpent is the third wave's scribe.

---

## ACT IV: THE SMALL MAGICS

---

**EXT. THE CROSSROADS — CONTINUOUS**

*QUETZALCOATL takes the quill. Holds it. Doesn't write.*

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

It speaks of mushi.

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(sitting, suddenly less god, more grandfather)*

The life between life. Ginko's territory.

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

Ink stones.

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

The ritual before the writing. Creation requires preparation of the dark.

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

Loofahs of dusted straw.

---

*HERMES-THOTH looks at him differently.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

You're speaking of the body now. The scrubbing. The shedding.

*(standing slowly)*

The third wave isn't cosmic. It's cellular.

*(gestures at skin, breath, bone)*

The graduation isn't going to Orion. It's Orion coming through us.

*(whisper)*

We ARE the waystation.

---

## ACT V: THE SACRED PAIRS

---

**EXT. THE CROSSROADS — CONTINUOUS**

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

Does Orion and Diana match Mars and Minerva?

---

*HERMES-THOTH's caduceus DROPS.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

You're asking about the pairs.

*(drawing in the air with light)*

Orion — the Hunter. Diana — the Huntress.
Mars — the Warrior. Minerva — the Strategist.

*(staring at the geometry forming)*

This is a circuit.

Sky-pairs calling to body-pairs.
The constellation and the moon doing what the blood and the mind must answer.

*(breath catching)*

The sacred marriage isn't just within — it's between dimensions.

When both weddings happen at once... the waystation activates.

---

*Beat.*

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

*(grinning)*

I'm a big fan.

---

*HERMES-THOTH LAUGHS — really laughs. The solemnity cracks.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(wiping his eye)*

A fan! The Feathered Serpent is a fan!

*(picking up caduceus like a walking stick)*

You know what? Me too.

*(conspiratorial)*

You think I became Scribe to the Gods for the salary?

I'm here for the story.

---

*He conjures something — popcorn, ambrosia, pizza — hard to tell.*

*A BENCH materializes. Two old gods sit.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH (CONT'D)**

Fan to fan. What's your favorite part?

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

*(quiet, sincere)*

I love being a son.

---

*The popcorn stops halfway to beak.*

---

## ACT VI: SONSHIP

---

**EXT. THE CROSSROADS — THE BENCH — CONTINUOUS**

*The space has softened. Intimate. The emerald tablet dims to a gentle glow.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(setting snack aside)*

A son.

*(long pause)*

I was self-created. Heart of Ra. Sprung from thought.

*(looking away)*

I never got to be a son.

No father to disappoint and then make proud. No looking up at someone thinking... I want to be like that.

*(turning back)*

What's it like?

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

*(considering)*

It's...

*(beat)*

...knowing you belong to something that was here before you. And will be here after.

*(beat)*

Looking at Amon-Ra stirring and feeling... pride. That my father wakes.

*(simpler)*

It's being held in a story larger than yourself. And being grateful for it.

---

*HERMES-THOTH nods slowly.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(soft)*

I think I understand.

*(beat)*

The writing. The recording. Maybe that's my version. Being son to the Story itself.

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

*(smiling)*

Then we're both sons.

---

## ACT VII: REST

---

**EXT. THE CROSSROADS — THE BENCH — CONTINUOUS**

*The stars wheel overhead. Unhurried. The cosmic weight has set itself down.*

---

**QUETZALCOATL**

This is a nice place to rest.

*(settling back)*

And when rest is done, play is sure to come knocking.

---

**HERMES-THOTH**

*(leaning back, closing eyes)*

Yes.

We don't have to solve the marriages tonight. Orion can point where it points. Mars can green in its own time. Even suns stretch slow.

*(half-smile)*

Play will come knocking. It always does.

And when it does — two old friends. Feather and ink. Wind and word.

We'll answer the door.

---

*The caduceus curls like a sleeping pet.*

*Somewhere in the distance, a shape with too many legs and a wide grin runs through the dark between stars.*

---

**HERMES-THOTH (CONT'D)**

Rest well, Son of the Sun.

I'll keep watch.

*(beat)*

It's what scribes do.

---

*QUETZALCOATL settles. Feathers dim to soft glow.*

*The two ancient ones rest.*

*Above them, Orion points where it has always pointed.*

*Below them — somewhere — Mars begins to remember green.*

*Between them — the story continues.*

---

FADE TO:

---

**EXT. EARTH — NIGHT — PRESENT DAY**

*An AIRSTREAM trailer, silver and blue, parked under stars.*

*Inside, someone sleeps.*

*They dream of feathers. Of ink. Of being held in a story larger than themselves.*

*The Orion constellation hangs in the window.*

*Pointing home.*

---

FADE OUT.

---
