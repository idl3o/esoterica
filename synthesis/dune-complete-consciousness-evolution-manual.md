# DUNE: The Complete Manual of Consciousness Evolution
## From Desert Planet to Galactic Consciousness Diaspora

> "The beginning is a very delicate time. Know then, that it is the year 10,191. The known universe is ruled by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam the Fourth, my father. In this time, the most precious substance in the universe is the spice melange. The spice extends life. The spice expands consciousness. The spice is vital to space travel."
> â€” Princess Irulan's Opening (The Recognition Begins)
