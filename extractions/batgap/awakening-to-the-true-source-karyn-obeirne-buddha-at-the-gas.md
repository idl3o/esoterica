Grace has no yardstick to measure us by, actually graces everywhere once we shift our perspective of what it is to be alive, be human with this brain we have, with our ability to be aware of being aware. Welcome to Buddha at the gas pump. My name is Rick Archer. Buddha at the gas pump is an ongoing series of conversations with spiritually awakening people.

We've done well over 700 of them now, and if this is new to you and you haven't seen any, would like to check them out.

Okay, thanks. I guess today is Karen O'Burn. I read her book, findings from the hunting parties scout. Hopefully you can see this book. And I have some notes, but the book was finished 20 years ago, so that we're going to get into stuff that wasn't in her book. But just in brief, Karen's spiritual journey, which was documented in the book, kind of starts out with her being an atheist and she goes through a number of rather intense years of spiritual growth with kind of a foot in both camps, an ordinary working soccer mom who is pursuing all these spiritual opportunities and traveling around the world, going to different holy spots and power spots and so on.

And she eventually became an embodied awakened faith leader. After a life-changing spontaneous awakening, which we'll be discussing, she shared her tultek teacher. Was it Dom Miguel Ruiz? Was his name? Ruiz. She shared his teachings and her own experiences as an interfaith minister, ordained by one spirit seminary in New York City.

In 2019, she was certified as a mindfulness meditation teacher taught by Tara Brock and Jack Cornfield. She incorporates methods of mindfulness, the four agreements, which is the tultek thing, and mystical teachings of the world's religions into her talks, workshops and writings. She shares wisdom in a non-denominational dogma-free style that is accessible to people who are searching for an open spiritual path that they can call their own.

On her sub-stack, Karen's findings, it's called, she released inviting grace in, a curated full year of quotes to guide readers through four seasons of spiritual growth, spring, uplifting spirit, summer, shifting perspectives, autumn, recognizing wisdom, and winter, expanding the understanding of our being.

And I've read a bunch of those and it's a wonderful collection of quotes. I need to sort of add them to my quotes collection. As a lifelong spiritual or social activist, Karen's posts highlight ways we can mindfully and compassionately co-create a world where all life is uplifted with a new understanding of ourselves and the source of existence we often call God.

So that's the intro. So Karen, what we're a minute ago before we started recording, we were just talking about something and you said, great, you were talking about grace. Repeat what you were saying and what you were telling me about grace. That might be a good starting point. Well, one of the things that when I, you know, after a lot of what had happened to me, I realized that, you know, and sometimes people question me, well, you know, why that happened to you or I guess why that happened to me or can I make it happen again.

But really, what I want people to understand is I didn't do anything or change the kind of person I was, but when I had my awakening, the spontaneous one that happened and it happened in my living room with a group of people, I wasn't very far on the spiritual path. I didn't know anything about non-duality or I wasn't interested in enlightenment and enlightenment.

I, you know, I just wanted to feel happy. I was a time in my life. I was like, I have this. I have what the culture tells me is what I want or what I should have, and I can't feel happy. So I didn't even have this really great reason to get spiritual. But yet, grace stepped in. That's what I call it when I get more into the story.

And I didn't, it wasn't like I was working on myself or trying to achieve something. But I did feel a lack. I felt a lack. When I started meeting people who are in the spiritual teachers and or have been doing this for a long time, you meet some people who have been doing it for 15, 20 years, I felt a lack.

Like I was, there was something that I, they had that I didn't. And that I just, I had this feeling of not being enough. So a lot, so I would have this sense of that. But when I look back, that's none of that matters when it comes to receiving grace, recognizing grace, opening to grace. Grace, grace has no yardstick to measure us by.

And actually, grace is everywhere once we shift our perspective of what it is to be alive, to be human with this brain we have, with our ability to be aware of being aware. All of these things have nothing to do with, you know, doing certain practices over and over or becoming a PhD in this or that's, that is a little great and wonderful.

But I want people to understand, we are enough exactly as we are in this moment to receive grace. You know, we're enough. And in fact, being enough is great because it allows us to be open. We're not chasing some sort of idea of what a spiritual person is or what someone who is worthy of grace or that grace only happens to good people.

That's not it at all. And I just wanted to to make sure that that's one of the reasons I wrote the book. I wanted people to say, hey, I'm just a ordinary person. But I, I went for it and throughout it, you can too. I didn't do anything extraordinary. I have learned and grown. It's been 20 years now. So it's, but when all this intense four years, I was on a ride.

I was just opening to it. And I think that's really the important part. We really have to let go of what we think we know. That's the biggest letting go. Yeah. You know, you may have noticed the subtitle of this show is conversations with ordinary spiritually awakening people. And those words are carefully chosen.

But one of my motivations for starting this is that, you know, I live in a town where several thousand people have been meditating for many decades out of ten, a total of 10,000 population. And a lot of people were popping. You know, a lot of people were having profound spiritual awakenings and, you know, shifting into higher states of consciousness as described in the ancient texts and all that.

And sometimes they would tell friends and the friends would dismiss them as delusional. They say, you're just an ordinary guy. I have known you for years. You know, you don't look different. It couldn't have happened to somebody like you. You know, they envision that you have to be sort of floating on a cloud or wearing white robes or whatever to have a genuine spiritual awakening.

And so I thought, I'm going to start interviewing some of these people and, you know, let people know that peers, ordinary people, just like them, are having spiritual awakenings and it can happen to them as well. Excuse me. I get all choked up when I talk about this. If you don't think it can happen to you, I think it's a self-fulfilling prophecy or it can be, you know, where you can delay or postpone the possibility of receiving grace as you put it.

Actually, you know, that was one of the things I, you know, if someone asks, it really helps to be open to the idea of grace. You know, it does help. That's I agree with you. But I didn't, but took me a little while to get there. So, because as you said, my father was an A.C.S. pretty much. She said he was an A.C.S.

my mother brought us up Methodist, Protestant Christianity. But at a certain point, I just saw religion as, you know, a power play, you know, because of all that the Middle East still going on. I mean, it's crazy. You know, Ireland, Protestants, Catholic, you know, if you look at history. And what really made me kind of lean towards my father's perspective of things was I have two older brothers and the brother that's closest to me in my age, Brian.

Very sensitive, intelligent, young man. And he was so shy and he had a lot of little difficulties, but he was diagnosed schizophrenic in his 20s. And he suffered. He suffered so. And I could not, could not conceive of a loving God that would let someone suffer like that for no reason. You know, I mean, and so it was kind of personal.

I personalized God that, you know, and I said, forget, I can't, I can't, I just don't believe in this, you know, whatever. But I don't know if you've ever read anything by Carolyn Mace. A little bit. I know she is. Yeah, the anatomy of spirit. And I don't know why I picked up that book, because, you know, because I was really getting, I was starting to read Buddhist stuff because they don't have like a deity pretty much.

So that kind of, and I was very interested in that. And humanist, you know, humanist movement, you know. But I picked that up. And I was working in New York City. I worked in New York City for many, many years. So I would take the train from Long Island, if anybody's familiar with that, the Long Island Railroad.

It's quite a long trip from where I lived. So I would read this. And I was reading Carolyn Mace Anatomy, a spirit. And I'm in one of those train cars where you're sitting facing the other people at the end of the car, right? So, and we're all New Yorkers' commuters. And we know we don't even look at each other, you know, you know, and you can't, after 10 years of commuting, either you sleep or you're gutted.

But anyway, I read something that she said that was like, you do all this, you get your books, you don't know, and then you have to let it all go, because you just don't know. Or whatever it was, I ate something like that. But whatever it was, it really, I just started crying. I don't know why. But whatever she said, you know, really hit me.

And that's another thing I'd advise anybody. If anybody starts weeping when they're reading something in a book, or if they're listening to a speaker, or anything, I think that's a good sign of a follow. If you're interested in finding your own spiritual path, because there's something inside of you, all the things that have made up your psyche to this point will respond often with tears.

So I'm there crying on the Long Island Railroad. It was so, you know, embarrassing. I'm embarrassed at the same time. I'm like, why is this happening? And so she opened the door that it doesn't have to be don't believe in God and believe in the God that I grew up with as a Protestant, because I just couldn't relate to any of it.

So she opened, that was what it was. She gave a, she gave, she opened up the space of what our idea of not even God grace. I think she, she uses a word grace a lot. And that gave me an opening to explore. And I'm always grateful for that because, and then of course I bought all copies of the books because that's what I do.

I find a book that I really love and I start sending it. I did that with the four agreements and I did that with inner bonding. But so that's usually the start of anything new spiritual adventure is it's a book or a podcast. And so that's another recommendation to, you know, turn off the TV and read a good book.

Oprah Winfrey was interviewing Eckert Toli one time and towards the end of the interview, she would, she would start, she would start sentences and have him finish them. Right? So one of the sentences was, I believe, and he said, in nothing in particular, you know, and, you know, here's a guy who has pretty profound experience and you think he has deep beliefs and profound things.

But the reason I like that is that belief is not all it's cracked up to be. You know, if you study all the different world's religions and all the different philosophies and everything, people get so invested in elaborate beliefs about the afterlife and God and, and, you know, what you should do and how you should dress and all this stuff and people, you know, thousands, if not millions of people have been killed for having beliefs that differed from somebody else's beliefs.

So it's just absurd. I'm often reminded of and often mention a video by Carl Sagan called Pale Blue Dot. You can find it on YouTube where you see on the screen a picture of the earth taken from somewhere out near Saturn by the voyage or spacecraft or something. It's this little pale blue dot. They have an arrow pointing at it so you can actually see what it is.

And Sagan gives this eloquent commentary about all the bloodshed and strife and war and whatnot that has taken place throughout human history over little tiny fractions of this pale blue dot. People thinking they're going to gain something by, you know, acquiring this little fraction and that little fraction.

And it just seems so absurd from that perspective. So belief, you know, it's not that important. What's important is what you really experience. And if you're not experiencing anything which could conclusively confirm this or that or the other belief or philosophy, then hold them all lightly and don't get so invested in them.

Yeah. And I think and I think people stop questioning when they're brought up in a certain tradition. And it's just surface, but but yet they'll they'll defend it, you know, because it's just like your sports team, you know. Yeah, I remember when I was in about second grade. I was walking home from school with a girl who was, you know, lived on my street.

And she told me that under the ground, deep down is hell. And people are down there. And I knew a little bit about geography and I mean geology at that point and I said, well, actually, there's all these strata of rock. And then there's molten, you know, lava and stuff like that deep down. You see it coming out of volcanoes.

There's no place down there where people are being tortured. And she was adamant. No, there is such a place. You know, there's there really is. You know, so there you go. And and and when I went to one spirit, you know, the first year is learning about the world's major religions. And they all sound crazy.

One spirit is an organization or one spirit seminary is an actual seminary created by Diane Burke and a few other people in New York City. And it's a two year program. But they have other programs too. But I went to the seminary because I was getting involved in the Unitarian Universalist congregation. You're my home.

And what I love about them is, you know, they have a set of seven principles and three of them are just fabulous from my standpoint. I just was so great. I fell in with them. The first one is the inherent worth and dignity of every person. The fourth one is a free and responsible search for truth and meaning.

So, meaning they're not going to tell you what to believe, right? I was like, I never knew there was a religion that would do that. And then the find the seventh principle is respect for the interdependent web of which we are all apart. So I found that so liberating. But when I so I I was heavily involved in the church.

So I met someone who had gone to one spirit. So I said, well, let me do that. The kids are in college. I'll go I'll go to seminary. But it's funny because we learn about the religions. And they all sound like crazy. If you take them literally, I know where it's done. And then I looked back and then I go and I look at Christianity.

I'm like, that's crazy. And so it's so Diane Burke, Reverend Diane Burke, who was one of the founders. She said the problem isn't this or that. It's when people start taking it literally the text because they're meant to spread their wisdom stories or they're this. But if you take it literally, you're going to end up with fundamentalism and you're going to end up killing each other.

Yep. Yeah. So I was really blessed to to follow that route. I just was great. And now I can respect because when you learn about the mystical core, you know, Jesus started, you know, Jesus didn't go around to start Christianity. But you know, his core teachings, his core experience, Muhammad, what's the Krishna Buddha, you know, founders of all these different religions.

And so when you when you learn about their experience and how they turned it into sharing, basically, they wanted to share it. That you, when that happens, you want to share it. And then it just gets further and further and further and further away from the original things. And so that's where forgiveness comes in for people who unfortunately are, are just can't get passed or don't question until something happens.

And it's and I think it's used. I think was it Marx who said, you know, religion is the opium. Yeah, that was garland. So, you know, and when you look at history, you can see how he could say that because it was crazy. Still crazy. Yeah. I mean, the thing is, mystics don't make good administrators. They're not interested in it.

You know, they're they're deep in their mystical experience. And so administrators come along and say, hey, well, there's a joke actually God and the devil are walking down the road and God sees something interesting on the ground, picks it up, puts it in his pocket, and they keep walking. The devil said, hey, why did you pick up?

What was that? And God says, oh, it's the true. It's the truth. And the devil said, oh, give it to me. I'll organize it for you. Yeah. So that happens every time administrators come in who aren't having the mystical experience. And necessarily don't get what the founder of the religion was actually experiencing and talking about.

And they end up with all their baggage and rigidness and cruelty and, you know, fundamentalism and so on. And the whole thing, knowledge crumbles on the hard rocks of ignorance as one of my teachers used to say. Yeah. So, but that's that's what it is. But we can transcend that. Yes. And be respectful because I, you know, I have people who are pretty devout Christians and so I have to be from respectful, but and they listen to me here and there.

So I want you to talk more about the awakening you had. And we never really defined grace. We just threw it out there as if people know what we mean by it. So let's hear about this awakening you had. And so we've been a definition of grace. Okay. Well, I eventually found my way to Don McGell or Weas. I read his book.

It made sense to me. It just made a lot of sense to me. And so I went to see him talk and then I went to Omega for a five day retreat. My husband went with me and it just was incredible. And part of part of what he did, he did a lot of rituals, but part and he had two two two helpers, two apprentices Rita Rivera.

And her name is escaping me now. But they had us as one of the things we did is envision our own funeral. But Rita Rivera was very good at setting the container and the, you know, the atmosphere. So you're there. You know, envisioning your funeral and she guides you. And so you go down and I see my casket and I see all of my loved ones and they're all sad.

And everybody's you can hear the people around you like people who had been sharing for the first two days about abusive fathers or just different difficulties and they're sobbing now that. And, you know, you go up there and you know, I look and I'm like, wow, you know, I'm dead. And I see my Joe and how sad he is and I'm like, oh my God, you know, I love them so much.

And I'm gone. I just want them to go on. I just want them to be happy. And then whatever, whatever. And then you hear Don McGell, he's got a very soft you know, um, Mexican accent. Why? Why do you wait so long to tell me you loved them? And everybody just, you know, when we realize, you know, we're just like, it's loving that is what is what it's about.

That's that but we don't realize it because it's we just take it for granted after a while. So that was just one way of doing it. And then he had another, you just had a bunch of rituals that took us out of our normal environment because it, I had never been on retreat. We'd never been at, you know, we were, you know, we were suburban couple.

Communing into New York City, it was like so different. That's another thing I would advise to people. If you really want to get engaged in a superior spiritual journey, you have to do something that's not in your wheelhouse. You have to do something that takes you out of what your routine is that challenges you, um, and, and, and expose yourself so that you can't be managing every moment.

Because that's what we have a habit of kind of a lot. That's what I realized. I was always managing the next moment because I wanted to be what I wanted to be. So I was never present. I was always in the future or, you know, manipulating things. And there's nothing better than not managing the moment. I guess I got totally to.

But anyway, six weeks after that, um, retreat where was an opening, again, an opening, like, like I had an opening about what God might be. I had, I had an opening of what, what is real, you know, because it's all about, we're conditioned. We're domesticated. But nine eleven happened. And I was there. I worked in Manhattan, 53rd and six.

And it was, you know, a horrific. I saw the people walking out of Manhattan because they weren't allowing anymore buses or trains or cabs in. So people had to walk over the bridge out into, the Bronx or Queens to get out of Manhattan. And I realized, I don't know when I'm, I don't know what time I have.

I just did that whole funeral saying it could be a reality. And don't wait. Don't wait. And I didn't. And we, you know, we would meet with Rita Rivera who would come from the West Coast to the East three or four times a year and have a weekend workshop where we all slept at a, you know, whatever kind of retreat house we could get.

And really deep work. And so I got to know about 30 people, you know, we would see this kind of the same people again. And that's another thing. When you can have a community where you can be vulnerable while you're going through this kind of seeing all the things that you believe that are all in like, you know, contrary to each other, just this bundle of beliefs and reactions and conditions and all this, you know, things where, you know, this is, this is how I live my life.

You know, you don't know it until you have time to process with someone who knows how to do that. And so it was the summer of 2003. So I'd only been doing this two years. 2001 was when I met Don Miguel. I invited a bunch of those people to our house on Long Island for a weekend just because no teacher, just to have them there, to be with them because we were, we could be our cellist.

We could take off the mask. That's a toll texting. We all have a mask. We have many masks. Take off our masks and be together in community. And it was Sunday morning and I asked, let's have everybody meditate before they leave. So we can do that together. We were in my living room in a circle, some people on the couch, a few chairs, and we said a prayer and we thanked Rita, you know, how grateful we are to her that we have this ability to be together.

And I noticed before when we were holding hands, when we said the prayer that my heart was beating like very, very erratically. And it was like, you know, when you put popcorn in a microwave and go, pop, pop, pop, you know, not a regular beat, very fast. I said, well, that's really strange. And then I let it go if everybody's hands and I rang the like Tibetan bell to start the meditation.

And I noticed I wasn't really thinking anything, which was very odd because I think a lot even when I'm meditating. And then I just felt the connection. I just, let me just feel the connection of these people I'm here with. I'm so, so grateful. My life has changed so much in two years. I feel things. I'm understanding better on less, you know, feeling happiness, closeness.

And then I had a vision of just these white lines, just kind of this soft velvety darkness, which I had felt one other time for. And just these white lines, you know, intersecting, but where we intersected, there was just space. So that's interesting. And I felt myself just opening up. And I felt, I really reached out to the people I'm just feeling.

And I kind of felt myself kind of slipping into them. And then something unhooked. And I was just out there. I knew I was me. I knew I was still Karen. It wasn't like, but I was boundless. I was, I mean, I was just aware of just, everything. And I knew everything. I was intimate with everything. And when I mean intimate with everything, with molecules, with atoms, with, it was, but I was experiencing it, but I knew it was an experience that was being given to me.

And the overall thing that held it together was this incredible love, just this incredible, unconditional love of its own creation. And it was intimate, and it was new. I just knew thing. And it was, you know, I was out of my body, obviously. And I was experiencing that. I was like, wow. And then I had a question pop.

I might, you know, what is this? And my dog barked. My dog barked. But it didn't matter. Because it was the realest thing that ever happened to me. I said, that's reality. That's the underlying nature of everything. And I don't know why, but I first explained to myself, God, let me, let me know what his heart and mind was.

Because it was that boundless and intimate at the same time. And like I said, love was more like, like the ooze that made it stuck, you know, made it all happen. And I didn't say anything to anybody because you can't talk about something like that after it happens. And I was just so grateful. I was so full.

I was like, I don't care if anything else ever happens to me in the rest of my life. I know this is reality. And we're just on the surface. And we're just kind of like you said, we have all our ideas. And we have all these theories and all these philosophies. And it's, you know, the essence is, this is one.

There's one source of this. And for whatever reason, I was able to experience it. And then after everybody left, I was kind of tired. So I laid down on the couch, you know, I was like, and as I was waking up, the first thing I experienced was terror, just absolute terror. And then I felt a grasping for some sort of identity.

Where am I? What is going on? And I didn't know who I was. And then kind of seeped in. And then I calmed down. I was like, that is really what is, what is that all about? And I said, I don't know, you know, but I was feeling calmer. And I said, I'm going to just go back to sleep because, and I did, I fell asleep again.

Same thing, terror. First thing of awareness is terror. And then grasping, you know, grasping for some sort of anchor, you know, some sort of identity. And then coming into it. And luckily, I kind of have a sense of humor, I think I've inherited it from my mother. But anyway, I heard Robin Williams voice from being a genie in Aladdin in the lamp, who says, a big powerful genie, teeny tiny bottle.

And I don't know why that pops into my head. But I said, yeah, you know, I don't know what happened today. I don't know why today, this is happening. But, you know, it's real. It happened to me. And I don't know what to do with this. But I'm going to keep going because I want this again. And I'll be honest, it never happened again.

Never happened again. But it didn't matter. And it doesn't matter. And that's why I call it grace. Grace stepped in. Grace stepped in and Grace stepped in in many ways. And for me, it was this. And I use it in my writings. I use it in my poetry. I use it in my sermons. But it's very hard to articulate. Because it's like I said, the feeling of love is there.

Now, how do you have feeling of love when, you know, you're not a body. I don't know. Yeah. So that's that's beautiful. If you thoughts on that, there was there is a send teacher. I don't know, I forget who his name. People told me. But he often said to his students, enlightenment may be an accident, but spiritual practice makes you accident prone.

So you had been doing some stuff. I mean, if you hadn't been doing your Don Miguel stuff and whatever else you've been doing for a couple of years, that might not have happened. You kind of set the stage for something like that to happen. For what's that saying? God helps those who help themselves. So, you know, that you had cultured some readiness.

Also, there have been great poets and so on who have had an experience like that. And then the rest of their lives, it inspires their poetry. But these things don't have to be a one shot deal. They can be more and more frequent and eventually stabilized. I believe that there are people walking the earth and have always been who are in a state like that all the time.

And it gets integrated. And that is not to say that you would be in a state of fear. That's just the initial kind of shock of the ego being dissolved. There's a great book called Collision with the Infinite, with a by a woman named Suzanne Siegel. Have you ever read that book? Anyway, she had been doing deep meditation practices for some years and but had sort of drifted away from that.

And she was in Paris and married and pregnant. And she was coming from a swimming pool, getting on a bus one day, and all of a sudden poof, big shift, just like you described. And she was immediately terrified because she couldn't locate and a personal self anymore. She was just like out there. And yet still able to get on the bus and nowhere to get off the bus.

And so on. And for 10 years, she went on like this, raising a daughter, getting a master's degree, and doing various things. But always like searching for a sense of personal self and in a state of fear because she couldn't find it. Finally, she met with John Klein, who was Francis of Seal and Rupert's, well, Francis of Seal's teacher.

Francis was a Rupert Spire's teacher. But in any case, John realized what had happened to her and just pointed it out and said, stop looking for a personal self. And then she kind of relaxed into it and went into an abiding state of unity consciousness. So these things can be cultured. That's what spiritual practice is ultimately all about is, not just giving us a momentary experience, but culture in a state in which that sort of thing is our living reality all the time, but very well integrated.

So we could do whatever normal things we do in life and certainly not be distracted or hampered in any way by that experience. And in fact, a state like that can actually enhance your functionality and your skill and action, your capability of doing things. When I say that didn't happen again, I have had other experiences.

Maybe just not quite so dramatic. And I think the terror, if anything, was it was so glorious that to come back to that limited persona or the limited, you know, not so connected, I mean, I think the contrast of it is what? So getting squeezed back into the bottle was a terrible part. Yeah, and squeeze back in the bottle.

Okay. So, but it didn't matter. That's that's the other thing I want to get. I did for a couple of years try to, you know, get conditions the same so that might happen again. And it didn't, but it but it left me so sure, so sure of that love, that that that source and that and that knowing, the knowing, it's like that it didn't need to eventually came to me.

It doesn't need to. I need to, to it makes you want to be in service of that love. Yeah. Right. So, so what what what happened is, and, you know, between the toll-tech dreaming, which is very powerful and then meditation and and different practices, I, you know, that that spirit of that, that grace of that doesn't form me when I'm in my writings.

And when I would put together services for the congregation or I would do a workshop or when I was picking the quotes for inviting grace in, that experiences always in and I don't want to say the background, but it's always referred to as truth. Yeah. That it keeps me on a kind of on a on a through line, you know.

Yeah. So that that that knowing of our ultimate source and unity and and that it's love. You know, I, I couldn't have made that up. I didn't know anything about non-duality or enlightenment or anything like that at that point. I was looking how to using the four agreements to shred myself of my of my conditioning, what Domagel calls our domestication into the dream of the planet, which, you know, is how we just kind of go go along and accept the way things are without understanding how we're, you know, we're just reacting to everything.

We're not choosing, we're reacting because we're conditioned a certain way. So that's that's that's what I was working on and I and I was pretty much I wouldn't say I was a mess, but I, you know, I had a I had X, you know, I had to go to a therapist for a while. I had a lot of you mean after that big opening?

No. I mean, that's the condition I was in when that happened. So so it wasn't like I was chasing an experience. It happened. It was nothing I could have made up. Yeah. You were trying to make it happen. Yeah. Because I wouldn't even know that there was such a thing. That's wasn't the spiritual books I was reading or that wasn't how Domagel was presenting anything or read us.

So that's how I that's why you use the word grace because yeah, it just um grace is something that happens that um is not um asked for. It's it's because like I said the source uh not only is it unbounded it's connected and it's intimate. It knows. Yeah. So and everything everything is well that's like a the Buddhist concept.

Everything is conditioned by everything that's happened before, you know, and nothing is separate on its own. It's just so um once we start paying attention that a lot of you know Buddhism is awareness and attention. Domagel, you know, four agreements. Total awareness awareness awareness paying attention directing your own attention mindfulness directing where your mind goes.

You'll start seeing grace. I was you know and because I had that experience, you know, I I can recognize it easier but it's happening all the time. These opportunities for us to to to enhance our lives to be kind to cultivate love to you know to to have access to joy to be joyful to have better relationships.

Grace is always there. We just don't see or turn to it because we're still in our conditioning, you know, we're we're still believing certain things. Um, and that's why we almost have to have put ourselves in a setting where you don't have control where all your assumptions and beliefs don't do you any good because it's just too new.

So, um, um, uh, it's so grace. You know, our heart is grace. Our, our, um, you know, our feeling heart is it's kind of like grace living inside of us when you think of it. I mean, where would you be without love without being able to love even if it's your love, your car? I remember I loved my minivan, you know, one day I'm driving down after, you know, so happy.

I was feeling so good. I was like, I'll put on the gas to pass somebody and that minivan just took off. It had a really that each cylinder says, I love my thing. And I realized it was when the love's coming out, that's that's the liveness. That's what brings us to that higher state. Um, and it's natural, you know, you know, you know, babies love, you know, come out loving, they come out scream and too.

But, um, and so what you were saying at the beginning, people just make things so complicated. But, um, it's dynamic and it's intricate, but it's not really complicated. Actually, it's simple. And we, we, we are created to receive this and then share it. I think sometimes we're blessed with a thing like that by God or by our guardian angel or whatever you want to understand it to be.

As a means of giving us a glimpse of what's possible and creating a kind of an implant that we can't forget. Sort of like, like Saul on the road to Damascus got, you know, who had been persecuting, persecuting Christians, got zapped and had this profound experience and eventually became the Apostle Paul totally transformed him or, you know, Richard Dreyfus in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, where he got zapped by the, the spaceship and he left an impression that he couldn't forget that just drove him to find this thing that he had to find.

So I think that happens along the spiritual path very often where we'll have a beautiful experience like that. And it's, it leaves a lasting impression. It really has, it actually does involve a subtle reconfiguration of our nervous system and our mind body system that is perhaps irreversible and that we're not going to be able to forget and it becomes an inspiration or a motivator to carry on and, you know, deepen it.

Yeah. Yeah. And I, you know, when it, it's kind of when I was learning about the, because that happened well before I went to one spirit or or got certified. It's mindfulness, you know, how these religions, you know, you know, touch on that. You know, they're, they're originators, they're original, you know, person who had the experience, Jesus or Muhammad or Buddha, you know, there's a commonality there and there.

So respect, you know, but then discernment. Respect, then discernment, as we said. But I just want to say what happened a year after that, we went to Ireland and there's a mountain called Krobe Patrick. And again, we're with Rita Rivera, another woman, Gloria, that we met when we went to France. And that was a power journey.

But anyway, so remember my, I had that thought, I said, I had that thought and then my dog barked and the thought was, well, what is this, right? So I was, I never got an answer to that because it was gone. So I met, you know, with a group of people, these are the dreamers, we call ourselves jimmers and we're, you know, not too far up the mountain.

And it was this little, just this little side place that we went that had a little spring and some wild flowers and this big rock. And we were just, she had us meditate, you know, fit and dream, meditate. And I'm just feeling the sun on me and the coolness of the rock and smelling the flowers and hearing the water and feeling the breeze.

And I hear these words in my mind, specific words, just, just so clear, it wasn't the first time it happened. But, and it, to me, it felt like the answer to my question, what is this? But it was put in these, these phrases, these three phrases. I am the awareness that allows the sun to be aware of the moon.

I am the awareness that allows the air to kiss the water and merge as one. I am the awareness that is God being aware of being God. And I just, I was like, yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer. We've exist because through evolution, because you can believe in God and evolution, you know, why not? We, as a species, and there might be other species, we have the capacity to be aware of being aware.

And I think that what happened the year before that experience is God wanting to, you know, I like being aware of, you know, of all this. And we're a conduit for that. We're a conduit for that awareness, which means we're not separate. We're not separate. God is always seen through our eyes and our hearts.

But the concept of God is what gets all mucked up. And so I, I, you know, I just left it as grace because the more I tried to have a concept of God, the further away I got from the experience, from the, you know, it just did. It had to stay open. It's just, there's no reason to put a label or a box it because when we do, we limit it.

We limit the possibilities of it. And for ourselves as this kind of evolved species that, you know, we can, we can reflect. We can reflect on ourselves. We can reflect. So I, I, years later, it's not in the book because it was after, you know, 2004. I had an experience, it was kind of like a purification thing in tail to walk in where we go.

And I was asked to speak, you know, later that evening just, and I didn't know what I was going to say. I was kind of wiped out. But I just relaxed about it. I was like, yeah, you know, I'm amongst friends. And what ended up coming out of my mouth was until we realized that everything is God. And I didn't think ever have that thought until it came out of my mouth.

So that's, again, I feel I'm being informed always by that experience. I don't have to be disconnected from this body, this mind, this ordinary to still benefit from that awareness still coming through me one way or another. And I was like, when my teacher heard me say that, she was just like, you got it, you got it, but why limit?

Why limit? You don't have to define God. It's just a word that I use because I don't have a better word. But you can feel it. You can have it live through you. You can, you can align with that. But don't, you can't rationalize your way to God in my opinion. Everything is God. I mean, of course, God is a word and words are concepts, but there's a reality to which that word refers.

And you can't rationalize your way into God, I suppose, although there is an intellectual path to God realization in the Vedic tradition called Yana Yoga. But if you think about it, I mean, those plants behind you, for instance, if you got a powerful microscope and looked at an individual cell in one of those leaves, you would see something that was more complex than, you know, the city of New York in terms of what's actually going on there.

And it couldn't possibly be happening through random chats or, you know, little billiard balls knocking into each other arbitrarily. There's an intelligence permeating every cell and every Iota of the entire creation. And there's nowhere you could look where you wouldn't find it if you knew what to look for and if you looked closely enough.

So, I mean, that's the kind of thing I think about when I think about the saying such as God being omnipresent. I mean, it's actually staring us in the face that this intelligence is omnipresent. And, you know, and what was the last of those three phrases that you came up with? Okay. Yeah. I am the awareness that is God being aware of God.

Yeah. It kind of reminds you of Muptananda's catch phrase, which was God dwells within you as you. So, you know, the whole thing is God. And we're just all the worlds of stage and all the men and women, merely players, we're just instruments of the divine, sense organs of the infinite. Yeah. For me, I came what came to me one time when I was at one spirit is, we are God's love made manifest.

Yeah. And we, and the other thing that the phrase that I really like for myself, I feel like I've been invited to the mystery. And the beauty of that is we are the mystery and we get to live it too. Now, to me, I'm like, how can I not be grateful? How can I not be grateful to, you know, yes, I'm a mystery to myself, but that's okay.

I can keep, you know, and I get to live this mystery, you know, and that's why I, like when I talk about making a spiritual journey that is of your own making of your own, that's the gift, you know, to use this wonderful mind and heart and then hormones and senses, it's a feast, you know. Now, sometimes it really hurts, you know, and you know, with my brother.

I mean, that didn't, you know, I mean, I have to come to terms well. Yeah, there's the mystery and sometimes it really is horrible and what happens to other people. So there's that, but we have a choice in any given moment where to put our attention. Sometimes I put my attention on where can I help? What can I do to either shed light or send money or be a good friend, or, and I can also put my attention on just feeling the gift of existence and not having to make it be anything other than what it is.

You know, at Gartolay, you know, the power of now was a huge thing just because he was so clear. He was just so clear. And like you said, he doesn't really have like this string of beliefs. I, after, after doing a lot with Dom Gell and the four agreements in Rita, you know, after a while, I needed something else.

And I started, oh, oh, it's because out of shanté put out a seat. Out of shanti. Yeah. Yeah. It was called spontaneous awakening. Right. And it was a series of his talks. And I started crying listening to that. I was like, oh, this guy knows what happened to me because he had a, you know, not, it's not the same as this, but some of the thing with a heart and boundlessness.

And I was like, oh, you know, because really my teacher, which I think was smart at the time, she didn't want to define any of that for me. She just said, remember how grateful you were before that happened. So the gratitude I had some to do with it, but she wasn't going to, she wasn't going to layer on any conditions on me from what happened to me.

And I appreciate that because that was the whole part of the four agreements was stripping away our conditioning. So, but, but listening to Ajashante, I was like, oh, you know, he kind of contextualized it for me, you know, to the extent that, you know, I could say, hey, this is happening to a lot of people or what was I, I don't know what I did with it.

But anyway, oh, yeah. So Ajashante said, told the story of way back, maybe the 1400s, whatever it was after Buddha, obviously. And there was a big meeting of all these Buddhist monks or teachers or, you know, sages and they all took time, took them weeks to get and they all got together. And they were waiting for the big Kahuna, you know, this one guy who was thought to be really the guy, the sage.

And it was time for him to come up and speak. And so everybody's waiting, you know, and he goes up there and he has a walking stick with him. And he just, all he does is he takes his stick and, you know, hits the earth a couple of times and then walks away. Well, you know, I wasn't sure, you know, exactly, can't remember what Ajash had said about that.

But, but finally, you know, I, that's stuck with me. I was like, you know, what I think for me what that meant was, hey, and it's also helped to have a cartoli, you know, just be present, not just simply be present and don't make a virtual reality in your mind about what is happening. Because that's how we live.

When we're not connected to the body, the emotions, the mind can just create these scenarios that have nothing to do with, you know, we think somebody's thinking this or they think we're thinking that about us or with it, it's a little virtual, you know, and it creates a lot of angst and suffering. But if we can simply be present to what is here and and let our senses take it in.

But don't create a virtual model of what's here. And what do you think prevents people from doing that and what can facilitate their doing it? I think it's habit. I think it's habit and we're not taught anything like that. You know, lots of distractions going on. You got your phone and your face and you got all the things on TV and all the other things coming at us.

And the mind is not is not a good barometer of reality. It really isn't. We think, we think things, we think that's what it is. And, you know, and our thoughts are coming all the time. That's why mindfulness is so good. Mindfulness, training, becoming aware of your thoughts. You know, thoughts are real, not true.

A lot of them aren't true. Most of them are repeats. 98% of them are just repeats. So we're constantly telling ourselves a story. We don't even check in anymore. And now it's like so easy not to, you know. Nature, nature is a good place to be. Yeah. Yeah. But mind, I would say mindful mindfulness straight like John Kabat's in and the mindfulness teach training I had.

It's become, it's being more and more aware of being aware, resting in the awareness. And instead of manufacturing scenarios in our mind. Yeah. We have to, the mind will, the mind will become the boss if we don't do some sort of mind training. Yeah. And one thing I often say to people is, if all of this sounds appealing to you and it's not your experience yet, but you'd like it to be, then do something.

You know, find something, learn something, start, you know, one step leads to the next and seek and you shall find, knocking the door shall be opened. Just, you know, get together with a teacher, go to a class, you know, do something online or in person. And you'll, you know, once you have that initiative, you'll be given the next opportunity when you need it at each step.

And if you're like super busy and you couldn't possibly imagine taking anything like this on, you're raising young kids or something, you know, if you have time to watch a TV show or whatever, there's, there's time to do some kind of meditation practice, learn something that's easy to do and that's enjoyable, that you feel like that you look forward to doing every day, not something that's unpleasant and try to stick to it.

And it'll immediately start yielding results. As the Gita says, no effort is lost and no optical exists. Yeah. And that, you know, I went back and looked at some of my, what I did is, have you ever heard of artist's way and morning pages? No. Okay. So Cameron, Julia Cameron wrote artist's way. But she has a thing called morning pages.

And so the first thing you wake up, you're just stream of consciousness, write it down. And, you know, it's not for everybody, but doing that, doing that, writing out, you know, on paper, your thoughts, it helps you see the repetitiveness of what's going on in your head. But it also helps because it's usually all junk.

So it's, it almost like taking out the trash before they start the rest of your day. And you don't, you don't monitor yourself. You don't, so there are ways to bring certain things to the surface. But if we don't express it in some way or pay attention to it in some way, we don't have the awareness of it.

So that's one way to, to do that. But I found this back in one of my more recent notebooks, keys to happiness, acceptance of the moment. You know, that, that's pretty big. You know, if you're always resisting, you're not going to go anywhere because you're in, you know, like, I just shanty would say, resistance is futile.

I think that, that actually came from Star Trek originally, I think, but anyway, I think so. One of those sci-fi movies. Because he had it at the back of the, of his, of the big room he was teaching in, you know, I looked back, resistance is futile. Like, what is that mean? So enthusiasm for the opportunity inherent in life.

So just thinking to yourself, you know, I'm here. Just, that's what I'm here. You don't even have to ask why am I here, which I'm sure. But just contemplate that. I'm here. You know, I'm alive. You know, there's opportunity here. You know, I'm not a rock. You know, I have a, where something simple is that to, to get out of that habit of, because we're almost like we're looking out of like a very small window.

And we've put ourselves in that box. It's like that pink Floyd song, another brick in the wall. You know, if we don't have some other way of perceiving or looking at ourselves or, or the moment, we just, we just get smaller and smaller, you know, our, our bandwidth for grace or whatever. So try to find some enthusiasm for the fact that you exist.

I think these things help. Like, acceptance of the moment. That's a very Byron Katie-ish kind of thing. But, you know, loving what is was her catch race. But there's something to that. I mean, if you have an attitude, like, oh, this sucks. I wish I weren't here. This shouldn't be happening. That very attitude is sabotages your, your experience of what's happening right now.

But if on the other hand, you have the appreciation that there is some kind of intelligence orchestrating the universe and whatever is happening right now is all as well and wisely put to use that biblical phrase. And there is some significance or value or opportunity in what I'm experiencing right now, even if I'm working at McDonald's or whatever.

It can change your whole perspective on what you're doing. And rather than despising the situation that you're in, you think, okay, well, this is what I'm doing right now. And let's take full advantage of it. And I won't be doing this all my life. And, you know, one thing will lead to the next. But, you know, every day is life.

And you don't want to pass over the present moment for some glorious possibility in the future. Right. Yeah. And like I said, when I went to that first retreat that I ever went to and I had to visualize my own funeral. Yeah. And I was like, yeah, I am alive. And that's me dead. And that's going to happen someday.

But let me not, let me not waste, you know. So we just never think of that. In fact, you know, in our culture, we pretend nobody's going to die. And then discerning and choosing one's own response and perspective, you know, what you just said, we do have control over that. That's probably the only thing we have control over.

Is our response in the moment and our perspective and our, you know, our engagement. We can't control anything. Everything is interconnected. It's so dynamic. That was a nosing day. I got just had this download of how it works. And I can't describe it, but it's so dynamic. It's like, you can't keep track of it.

There's no way. So anybody who thinks they can like, I got think of the people who are in office now, they think they can control the country and manage, you know, this and the foreign affairs and what they're doing. But it's an illusion because anything could happen because everything's connected. So something could happen who knows where, you know, and which should just change the whole thing.

So the only thing we really have control over is how we respond to life, to what is happening and how our attitude, our perspective of it. And we do have control of that, but we have to be aware of being aware, you know, we can't just go around reacting through our senses because, you know, then we feel powerless.

And not having control doesn't mean powerless. It just means you have to accept in the moment, this is what it is. And then, I mean, you can take apart the word responsibility. It's the ability to respond. And we can culture that ability. And I mean, the time to culture it is not right now. But, you know, the time to prepare for, like, let's say, a dance recital or something is not the moment of the dance recital.

It's the time leading up to it where you prepare to be able to do it properly. And so every, there's another gate of verse, you have control over action never over its fruits. Live not for the fruits of action nor attach yourself to inaction. So every moment is an opportunity to increase our, or improve our response ability, our ability to respond to whatever else is going to be happening.

And there's one more verse I'll throw in here, which I've quoted before. It's from the yoga sutras, which is the danger, which is not yet come. You know, when the, when the danger comes, it's, you have nothing, you can't do anything about it as you were just saying, but you can do something now to avert the future dangers.

Like, maybe you have some karma coming down the pike that'll cause you to break your leg, but you can perhaps do something that, when that moment arrives, you'll, you arrive, you'll stub your toe instead. It'll, you can lessen the impact of future repercussions or karma coming down. Yeah, um, I'm not sure I see all of that, but, um, but karma is, is, is, is another one of those words that has so many connotations.

So, um, I, I, I do the cause and effect, but taking responsibility of what happens, even though we don't cause it, you know, it's really give me an example. Um, let's see, I had, I had a friend and we were very close, but certain things happened and we kind of had to dissolve the, the friendship, and I, you know, it was a loss.

It was a loss, but, um, and, you know, of course, I would tell my story to somebody and they'd say, Oh, yeah, yeah, she was, and then she tells her, but I had to take responsibility for that, it would, I chose to let that relationship go down rather than to keep trying to have it work, you know. And that might have been the right thing to let it go.

Yeah, but I, but I take, I stop blaming her and be responsible for my own either unskiltful means of responding or reacting, where I was actually reacting to certain things, but so that, that, and that I think helps maybe and maybe it's like, I don't know, sure. And what you're saying, as you learn from something that you take, you claim responsibility for rather than blaming, you can avert other things in the future because you're learning to be aware of your own reactions or responses and, and learn from that.

So it's like, instead of just being reactionary all the time and saying, well, that, you know, how come I always meet these same kind of people? Well, maybe you're not always meeting these same kind of people. Maybe your response or your reaction to certain things continue to cause the same sort of issue, where if you take responsibility for it, take agent, you know, have some agency in this situation that you're not recognizing.

And it's uncomfortable to do that because it's not flattering, obviously, you know. You know, I was mean, I was petty, I was, but you have to recognize those things, not to beat yourself up, which is, you know, I got to be careful with that, but to learn, to grow. And that, I see how you can avoid similar things, but I'm not sure, I just not sure.

I mean, I was there for 9-11 and these people just went to work one day. Sure. So are you saying that that makes it hard to understand how there could be such a thing as karma? No, I'm just saying karma. I don't, it's not personal. I don't know how personal it is. I mean, I guess certain traditions say each person has their own particular karma, but I'm like, well, you know, I don't know.

I guess that could be true. I just, it's hard for me to see because, you know, tsunami happens because the earth opens up. Sure. There's a wave constant. Plates shift or something like that. Yeah. So how is that personal to me? Was I, are you, is it telling me that I was particularly put there at that time so I could be pushed out by a wave?

So that's why there's, it's a paradox. It's very, very personal, but it's also not personal. Right. And some would argue, like this is an example of what we were talking about earlier, which is that you can take everything as a hypothesis. And there are so many different beliefs. You know, some religions and traditions would say, oh, yes, if there's a plane crash, everybody on that plane had the karma to be in that crash.

And it was all arranged by cosmic intelligence for them to have that experience. Then other people would say, it was an accident. It was arbitrary. You can't read that much into it. And there is no cosmic intelligence orchestrating everything. You know, shit happens. That kind of thing. So I lean more in terms of cosmic intelligence orchestrating everything, but I don't hold that as an adamant certainty.

I don't hold anything as an adamant certainty. It's just that kind of makes sense in terms of to me, with my worldview of things, that nothing is accidental or arbitrary and everything is orchestrated by actually to quote the Gita again, it says karma is unfathomable. Human intellect cannot possibly fathom the mechanics that would be involved in in the way it works if we accept that it works.

But it's, you know, it's just one way of looking at things. And I don't think there's any compulsion to believe in it or anything. If it works for you, great, if it's just an interesting thing to think about or if you don't believe in it and you'd like to argue against it, great, you know, what a life is for learning as Joni Mitchell saying.

I can see that I, I mean, there's always cause and effect. So things happen because of something else. Right. That's just, yeah, but it's just how you're going to interpret that. And that's up to our, that's up to each person, how they, how they want to. Yeah. And another element we could throw in here is, is there an evolutionary trajectory in the universe?

Do things happen for an evolutionary purpose to foster the growth of human or not all human to grow the evolutionary development of souls? Or does that just happen sometimes? And other times, things are just totally accidents and they don't have any evolutionary significance or meaning, something to consider.

What do you think? Well, I think, I think the evolution, evolution, that is intentional. That is intentional. And it's intentional for, for us as beings, aware beings to be more participatory in this. And we do that by aligning with, you know, higher principles, love, the interdependence, you know, kindness.

I mean, Dalai Lama, you know, my religion is kindness. It could change the whole world. There's so many things that could change the whole world. So I do feel that, that is evolutionary. And I just, since you brought it up, it's also, it's like the trifecta for me, the awakening by, you know, the expansion of my awareness into everything.

And then, you know, I am the awareness of God being God, that message. And then the dream I had, this is again, at least 10 years after the book, I was studying with another teacher, she's a nasty Christian because I was I was exploring Christianity just because it was how I was brought up. And I wanted a different perspective of it.

And we were going to go on retreat. And she told us, about five of us, she told us the night before on the phone, when you go to sleep tonight, you know, look for your, look for a guide, look for your guide, you know, and see what they have to say. And I'm like, you know, I know I, there's probably angels that kept me alive during my 20s because I was very reckless, but I don't know.

But I said, well, you know, I kept it open to mine. And I had this dream. Now, there are dreams. And then there are dreams, you know. And so in the dream, I, I'm in this cylinder stone kind of ancient tower, you know, and you can see the, you know, the big giant chunks of granite that built and it's all circular.

And there's nothing else in there. And then I look over and I notice a narrow window. And I go over the window to look out. And it's absolutely stunning. I mean, the colors, and it's just alive with life. And it's kind of choreographed and it has a path or whatever. And did you ever, you know, in the Wizard of Oz when Dorsi lands and Oz, and she opens the door, she goes from black and white to color.

Well, that was like the inside of this turret cylinder. And looking at it was so different. And I just say, oh man, who created this? And a voice says, human's dead. I'm like, no, we don't create like that. And I'm envisioning in my head, you know, like, you know, the, you know, these cities, you know, ghettos, you know, just we just, so we have concrete jungles and all this.

I was like, no, no, that's, we don't do it. That's not how humans do this. And the voice just said, they will. Nice. And, and so I was like, woof, but it was, you know, and that, so I said, I don't know where, what this was, but it was, you know, a message. And it's taken me a while, but for me, that, that, that turret, that concrete is something we build.

I think we talked about this already. But, that we, that we have created this, this inability to, to see, but we have that window of opportunity. And, and that's, that's, that's, for me, is the messages. We have to participate because we created the, the, the bricks and the walls, but we have an opportunity to be creative.

And we want to create with awareness and with, and in alignment, you know, a different motivation than, than the level we are now. Interesting. That's what I, yeah. Yeah, that's cool. It was a hopeful, it was a hopeful gene, even though it was just like, now, how do I get out of this turret? I don't want to just look at the window.

Well, how do you do that? You have to take down the turret and you have to create differently from a different place than what we do now. And, that's, yeah, that's one of the opportunities. Perhaps a vision of possibilities. I'm listening to a podcast called The Last Invention, which is about AI. And it's mainly interviews with the most knowledgeable people in the world about it, who have created it.

And about half of them think it's going to kill us all. And about the other half think it's going to save us all. But they all agree that it's more impactful than the invention of the printing press or just about any other human invention that has come along. But there was one woman I was listening to in the podcast who felt like, you know, when you look at it, the problems confronting humanity are insurmountable.

I mean, there's so many things which we're not showing any sign of solving, which you're only getting worse. And we don't really seem to have the wisdom or the resources or the intelligence to solve. And perhaps this will do it for us because if we achieve what it's called AGI or artificial general intelligence, it would be like a country full of Einstein's, you know, geniuses, that level of intelligence to bring to bear on our various problems.

And it may well come up with things and is already, in some respects, coming up with things that we are just not going to get otherwise. So it could be nature's response to a dire situation that we've created for ourselves or the trends of time have created. And then there's something beyond that called SI, artificial super intelligence, which will be that AI is recursively self-improving.

So it can just improve itself and it'll just take off far beyond our comprehension or ability to control or contain. And that's where it gets scary. But this is actually where humanity is on the verge of this happening and very few people are aware of it. And they don't know what's just around the corner.

So I don't know why I went on this rant, but I think it is significant. I mean, people might watch this 20 years from now and think, wow, he was right. Not that I came up with this. I'm just listening to a podcast, but we didn't see this coming and it has totally rocked our world. And I'm just hoping it rocks it for the better.

Anyway, that's going to be how it's used. Yeah, how it's used, which again, it's like with every other technology, nuclear technology or anything else, dynamite, anything we've invented, the power of the technology tends to vastly outstrip our wisdom and our intelligence and our maturity as human beings.

So, and that actually comes back to what I think you and I have been motivated by all these years, which is to do something to help advance the spiritual maturity of humanity in each and our own way as best we can. Because, you know, that alone is the ultimate fulcrum or influential point from which everything else is steered in one direction or another.

You know, some people always think, well, you know, if we could just get a great leader to take over the nation and he'll set everything right. But, you know, how can he, or she, if hundreds of millions of people are just in a relatively low state of consciousness, emanating the kind of influence one emanates from a low state of consciousness, you know, we're going to have problems, you know, that's the only thing that's going to save us as a change in consciousness.

Exactly. Remember, new dimensions radio that used to be a guy named Michael Palms and his wife, Justine, this is way back in the 80s, it started on and they'd play it on NPR. I used to love the show. I think that he died, but I think she might still be doing it, but he would start the show by saying it is only through a change in consciousness that the world will be changed.

And I used to say, yeah, every time I heard that. And, you know, that's what we need to do. And the more people who realize it, and that's what motivates this show, that's what motivated me to become a meditation teacher when I was 21, that's what we need to do in order to assure the kind of vision you had from that tower comes about rather than some dire dystopian thing that might otherwise happen.

Yes, yes, and it is possible. I was listening, I can't remember the podcast, it was just all of a sudden appeared in my feed or something and this one woman was saying how, you know, most religions and a lot of things think, you know, we have to suffer in order to grow. And she said, but, you know, the goal, not the goal, but the evolution is to not to have to suffer, first to grow, but to grow from, you know, from a different experience, you know, like the experience I had, but to do it collectively so that we, because with the suffering, if, you know, we're just keep creating it, you know, yes, we do grow from suffering.

I'm not saying, in fact, I love that there's a phrase, Joseph Goldstein, you know, don't waste your suffering, learn something from it, you know, you know, don't just, but I would just, I would just love to see us to create, not out of learning from suffering, like, you know, NATO came out of that horrific world war too, but can we, can we create out of something positive that we cherish joy, you know, and we do some things we do, like Beethoven's ninth symphony, you know, move to joy.

So we do, but he was, you know, he was exceptional. Can it, can it be more universal where, you know, we are at a place of awareness and consciousness that we, we create out of sharing joy, more often than because, you know, situation is, you know, like, we can't afford to feed everybody in the world.

Well, we can, we just have to change the damn budget. Stop, you know, stop putting billions and billions and billions of dollars into, you know, warfare, you know, I mean, everything is possible, but we choose the wrong thing because we're crazy, you know, not, you know, not personally, but the constant arms race and the constant, you know, killings over what, you know, that it changes anyway.

It's such a waste. That's my, that's my, that's my argument with the powers that be God, I know. But we have agency over that. Yeah. That illustrates what I was just saying, which is that, um, a certain ambient collective consciousness is going to percolate up into certain kinds of policies. And you can't hope for better policies if you haven't changed that ambient state of collective consciousness.

If you haven't raised it, um, we're going to be bellicose, we're going to be, you know, greedy, we're going, you know, we're going to let people starve and whatnot if we're coming from a low level of consciousness. I think that the world could be a, a heaven like you perhaps glimpsed in that, in that vision.

And the resources could easily be there. Um, you know, there's no reason for starvation in Sudan right now is just these stupid warring factions that are, you know, depriving people of food and, or Gaza, or, or whatever. Um, the problems, well, let's, let's put it this way. Who, who, you don't solve the problem on the level of the problem.

Um, the problems are inevitable if we function as individuals or as a society from a relatively low level of consciousness. If we could raise our collective consciousness sufficiently, then we would find everything on the surface changes dramatically and profoundly. If we can't raise our collective level of consciousness, no amount of political or economic tinkering is going to improve the situation it never has.

Which is not to say it's not good to have the United Nations and to doctors without borders and to try to make all these efforts. But, you know, that alone isn't going to cut it if we don't take care of the foundation, which is, what was it? Thoreau said, um, you said, go ahead and build your castles in the air.

That's where they belong. But now put foundations under them. Yeah. That's beautiful. Yeah. Um, that's why I, I ended up, um, doing mindfulness training, um, you know, becoming a teacher because I said, you know, that's the only way. Yeah. That's the only, and now when I see people who, you know, are, are in kind of that lower state of consciousness, that kind of unawareness, consciousness, you know, I have sympathy for them because I was there myself at one point.

And, um, and it's true. Usually we don't seek out, um, spirituality or, or raising our consciousness unless something hits us over the head like an illness or, you know, a loss, you know, so I don't know. So I, I would love maybe, hey, I can figure out how to make it popular. You know, I don't know, you know, I don't know.

Maybe, maybe it, you know, would be nice if one of these video games was something that actually elevated people's consciousness. Could you imagine all the game? Well, they would have to be a market for them. And if kids are not spiritually motivated, you got to hide it in there. You got to sneak it in there.

Okay. Easter eggs, they call them. You hide it in there. Hey, hey, he's got, got to be sneaky. Yeah. That, you know, that's part of the game, baby. You know, that's, that's one of the things that, that's when I could get on board with AI. I'm at an age where I had to, I learned DOS and I learned this. And I had to learn all these platforms.

And now I'm like, I can't, I can't handle one more, one more new technology. But it's getting easier and easier. I use it all day long intermittently. Just give me somebody to talk to, which, in fact, this, this software we're using to record this interview when it's, when I'm done, it will, you have, it will have used our AI to automatically transcribe the whole interview to suggest excerpts that might be highlights that we could put up on YouTube.

And to, it'll, it uses AI to correct the sound and make it, you know, much more balanced and rich as, as if you've recorded it in a studio. So it has all kinds of useful applications. But like every other technology, in the, if we don't raise collective consciousness, and I think the dystopian, dystopian scenarios may play out, it could end up killing us all.

It's, it's, it's, it's not going to just have a mind of its own, although some speculate that it will have this maternal instinct and take care of us and disarm us. But it's a little more likely if we are operating from a low level of consciousness than this technology we have created will be very dangerous.

Well, I, the good news for, from my perspective is having experienced these different experiences and, you know, guidance. It's okay if we're all dead. We're everything anyway. You know, we can't go anywhere. There's nowhere to go. We're not, I'm not going to, it's not going to be Karen O'Burn, you know, was, you know, blah, blah.

But I am part of the source. So there's no place to go. So, you know, who knows? I just want to be awake. I say, I want to be awake when I die. I want to be aware where I die. I want to, I'm very curious. But knowing that I can't be separate from that which is my essence that created me, you know, I'm not the body.

We know that, you know, we just, we're not. So it takes the edge of what's horrible is the way we might end up doing that. That's horrible. But, but being instinct, even the human race being extinct, there's life everywhere. Yeah. So, it eventually will be. I mean, five billion years, the sun's going to expand and the earth will become a molten blob.

And long before that happens, there won't be any life here. But you and I will still exist on some level in some way. What form or, I don't know, I'm very curious. But having been formless, you know, that's not bad either. But, you know, I feel, I feel that, you know, I, I'm in love with life. You know, I, that's the other dimension of the spiritual journey.

It's fully in love with life. And so I have that joy. And then I have the sorrow that it is often taken so lightly by people who inflict suffering for no reason. So there is that, you know, it's it's holding that both. But, but I have a fondness for this form. I have a fondness for the way we, you know, the, the sensual things the senses can do.

And just to be think and speak and grow and read and create these beautiful music. So, but, you know, love is at its core. Love it at its core. I have several poems. Well, you're just going to, if you don't mind, I just want to read one, one. Sure, why don't you look for that up? I'll just make a comment which is that you had fondness for your old minivan.

It was great, a great minivan. But you probably don't have that minivan anymore. You have something new. But, you know, so at some point, we won't have these bodies. And at a certain point, we'll probably begin to feel like it's time to trade this one in. You know, it's pretty, pretty rickety. And, but then, you know, there will be a new beginning.

Yeah. Right. That's like nature, right? Everything is recycled. Yeah. Everything. But this is, this is a poem I wrote. I didn't write poetry at all. And I went to a new moon meditation that, oh, good lord. Alex Gray. That is sacred chapel of mirrors. You know, Alex Gray. I know his art, you know, that amazing psychedelic art.

Yes. So he had a place in New York City, sacred chapel of mirrors. And so my friend and I had never been, we went, but it was the night before Halloween. And we didn't realize that. So everybody was dressed up in costume waiting to get into this building because in the floor above Alex Gray's place, they were doing one of those fright night things where, you know, they go out and, you know, scarier, you know, you go through a maze.

So while we were meditating, we keep hearing this. You know, it all this while we're meditating, right? It was, it was so funny because before that they had the nice music plane and they got us in and then all this hell broke loose upstairs. So this is the poem he invited everybody to be creative because he's a creative guy.

So just, just, you know, take a piece of paper and you can write a song or you can make a drawing or do whatever. And this is what I came up with. This is what I, what I mean by, you know, just grace appears, you know, I'm like, I, I never wrote a poem, but this is, it's called the poem for celebrating the wholeness of life.

What great fun this heaven, this hell, creation made of my shadow, creation made of my soul, creation both of light and form, reflections of the whole, seductive illusion, love is at its core. I cannot stay sad or be sorry when it is life that I adore. Very nice. That's nice. So it's fun to create, you know, this is what we're offered, you know, this existence.

And I just encourage, like you said, if you're feeling the call or you, you want to have some of these experiences, get clear about what it is you want. Just right now, my, my motive for doing what I did 20 years ago is different from my motive now. But whatever, be clear to yourself and then take the next step.

Just take the next step. It's so much easier now. The internet has so much free stuff. And with, you know, zoom, you know, if you live in a place where there aren't many teachers, you can do it online. And then I would still recommend you do something in person when you get a chance because there's nothing like that being with another group of people.

There's nothing quite as wonderful. Yeah. That was a nice poem. Yeah, I couldn't believe and I read it. I read it to the whole group. I couldn't believe that either because I was, believe it or not, pretty shy. And I was like, I said, nope, I created. I'm going to read it. Risk putting yourself out there. Be vulnerable.

And when you think about, if we are the microcosm of God, if we're like a man is made in God's image, if what that means is that we are kind of like little mini gods in our own individual lives, that reflecting certain qualities that God, the totality has, which I think we are, then, you know, all the dramas of our life are kind of reflective or representative of the dramas of the universe itself.

And you know, we honor great dramatists like Shakespeare, not for just writing comedies, but also for writing tragedies. It's all part, we find them all entertaining. Well, I like to say I think it's in one of my side. God loves a good story. Very good. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. I can talk a little bit about the very, very, very, at least in my life and I think it's universal self-compassion.

So even though I had gone through all these wonderful experiences and studied with Domagal and studied without Ashante and came a minister, there came a time in 2003 when like all these things happened, you know, my brother died. I lost my job. I had a problem with something with the congregation that didn't work out the way and I kind of fell into this funk and I couldn't understand because, you know, I don't really get depressed, but I was just feeling so caught and just like malaise and just doing self-destructive things that I thought I had given up.

And one morning I was waking up and as I was waking up, I heard my own voice. I could tell, I know what my voice is. And it was just so awful. It was just saying, oh, you know, it's saying, you know, you shouldn't know them better, look at you now or something, something to that, just nasty. And I was like, I can't believe I'm still doing this, that this is still here, but I guess everything had to be that bad for it to come back.

And I didn't know how to get, I just didn't, because everything was bad. I didn't know how to turn it around, you know, it was so strong and that stuck. But I happened to hear a podcast by, she wrote a book called Inner Bonding, Margaret Paul. And you can type in inner bonding into, you know, Google and, you know, she has this whole website.

But what it is is it's basically reparenting yourself because that voice comes from a source that you that set up when we're children. And I thought I had dealt with all of that, but apparently not because it came back in force when I felt that I had failed, you know. In certain ways. And that's what I like about the mindfulness training because the two wings of mindfulness is awareness and compassion.

And Tara Brock really teaches very well about self-compassion. And that's why when I do the lead a meta meditation, when it comes to the part, you know, may all beings, because you're supposed to start out, may I be this, you know, may you be this and then may all beings. But what I found is people like me and a lot of people have a lot of trouble saying, may I be happy, may I be safe.

And then I realized somehow growing up, I felt not really worthy of either happiness or safety or for some, that was really deep in there, that somehow I was undeserving of that no matter what I did. So now when I do the meta, I say as I am one of all beings, because I never had problems saying may all beings be happy, may all beings, I want all beings to, because what a wonderful place it would be.

Happy people, happy people don't go around, you know, doing what some people do. But when it was came to me, I, you know, I hit that, that resistance, like there was a belief, you don't do that, you don't wish that for yourself. So as I am one of all beings, we have to include ourselves in our compassion for others.

And often we don't. We kind of close our heart to ourselves, we abandon ourselves when things, certain conditions are there. And I wanted to just let people know that there are ways to come out of that kind of knot of, you know, trans of unworthiness is what Tara Brock calls it. And it's a lot in the Western world.

And I don't know if it's, you know, different religions or the way we raise our children or something or the competitiveness, I'm not sure. But that can be a real hindrance, but there is a way out of that. And I encourage everybody to to, you know, I've done sermons on it. But to, if you're, if you have, if you've sent something like that, that's holding you back, you know, please reach out.

You know, you know, like I said, you can go to inner bonding, but it is a, it is a very damaging thing on the spiritual journey. If, if we have expectations of what we should be doing or, and we have a setback, it can be detrimental to further growth. And it's painful, it's very painful. So I learned through suffering, you know, but I had been exposed through other spiritual traditions, you know, to, to seek help.

I recognized what it was. I knew it wasn't truce, but it's still affecting me. It was still kind of in there. So I just want to say how important on the journey, it's so much better when we have self compassion, true self compassion. So I just wanted to say that. Well, a question came in that's related to what you're saying.

This is from Kenny Hogan. I bring, I hope, my pronounce it correctly in Scotland. And he asks, it seems that grace sometimes can give people a nudge, sometimes cause physical or personal disturbance to stop them in their tracks, forcing them to refocus their attention away from their condition state of being.

Should we be fearful of grace or simply accept that grace is redirecting our life from a higher perspective? Nice question. Yes, thank you. Yes, I, I would firmly say we don't, we don't need to fear grace. We are always held in grace, you know, it doesn't seem like it. And it has to do with the conversation we have before.

We're in this form now, but we have an internal beingness to us. And we don't know how long this beingness will go on or what form it will take. But grace, grace is here to, like you said, guide or nudge. Cause grace maybe has a vision of something better for us. But we often don't pay attention until it's like in our face and kind of scary.

We get comfortable, I get comfortable, you know, I got, I was very comfortable in my, you know, life before I, you know, at all this went on this journey. And sometimes we need to get, you know, kind of kicked, you know, kicked, not kicked around, but we need, we need, we need an interruption and, and it's hard for us to interrupt ourselves.

So grace steps it. Yeah. And one way of understanding grace is that we're not alone. I'm, there, I've interviewed a number of people who actually perceive the celestial beings or guardian angels or those, those kinds of entities that are, they say more numerous than we are actually. And that are constantly interacting with us in ways that we don't perceive, but which nonetheless influence us.

And so I think there is a, as I said earlier, an evolutionary trajectory to the universe. And you know, as all the sayings go and God loves us. And sometimes your mother loves you, but sometimes she needs to scrub behind your ear with a washcloth, you know, because you've got some dirt there, and it's, and we, we scream and cry and resist.

But I think there's definitely some kind of higher intelligence, however you want to understand it that helps to guide our, our growth and our evolution and even to steer the course of our life in terms of going towards certain things and away from other things and so on. And we can ignore it, but the, the more we ignore it, the more likely we are to get scrubbed with that, with that raspy washcloth.

Yeah, and what I found, the more I paid attention and was clear in my own yearnings, I noticed that like that's how, you know, I only found four agreements because somebody handed me a flower, a flyer on my way to lunch, you know, in New York City, you know, in the year 2000, it was the year 2000, you know, and back then the internet wasn't like it was.

That's how you found out about something, but if you worked in New York, you never took a flyer, otherwise you'd have 10 flyers in your hand by the time you got back from lunch. But I happened to take that flyer, and then I actually looked at it and the book intrigued me. So in my mind, that was grace too, because what were the chances, you know, and then, and then when I went to see him talk in the city on the pew, because it was in a church, a lot of times they do these talks in the churches because they're cheaper, it gets to rent out.

There was a flyer for Omega, which I had never heard of, that he was going to be doing something in that July. But if I hadn't gone, I never, who knows, my whole life could have been end up being different, you know. So even grace, when it doesn't look like it's loving, I think you're very right that it's nudging us in a direction.

Yeah, I really think so. Pay attention. That's the thing about mindfulness. Boy, when you start paying attention, you know, instead of just paying attention to the thoughts that go around and around when you really start paying attention, the opportunities are there. Very good point. So we should start wrapping it up.

Is there anything you do that people can interact with? Like do you do Zoom meetings or anything like that? Well, what I'm going to be doing is what I thought of, you know, because I've done the inviting the Grayson, so you can always subscribe on substacks. I can't, you know. Okay, and I'll put a link to your substacks thing on your back page.

And you'll get that free every Sunday, those quotes. And it's going to be more interactive come probably in January once I get the chat going. But what I really, the one thing I really would have liked when I was going through this was to have just to be able to talk to somebody to articulate what was happening to me with someone who had been there and just have them listen and maybe like nudge, nudge me in a certain direction or this direction or whatever.

I just, even though I had a teacher, she had a lot of students, they don't have a lot of time. So, I'm offering, you know, kind of one-on-one conversations and perhaps mentoring. So, you know, always go to caranoburn.com and put in your name, your email and what you're interested in and perhaps having a conversation about and I can contact you and we can have a brief Zoom thing and see, you know, if there's anything within the conversation that can be helpful or provide some clarity or maybe you just need to articulate what's happening.

And like I said, even if you write it down, if you don't do anything like a conversation, I think that accelerates everything when you can articulate it. Because if we just keep it in our head going like this, and so there's that, and then also, if somebody already has a group and they'd like me to come and speak or speak over Zoom, I have a lot of different over the 20 years, a lot of, and I have mindfulness workshops and all different relation, mindfulness and relationships and things like that.

Okay, so I'll put a link to your caranoburn.com on your Bat Gap page and people can click on that to get there. Yeah, and if they want to contact me, but I'm keeping it loose. I don't want to put it in a box. I've recreated what I do many, many times and I want to be in the flow. I just want to help people who are at the point where they're just not playing around.

They're serious. Personally, what are you most curious or passionate about exploring next, spiritually or socially, anything in particular that is on your horizon? Well, kind of what we talked about, I want to explore how we can create from being in an alignment with that, with source. To be open to not having to suffer, to grow, you know, finding ways of shifting the perception enough.

I'm also very interested in the end of life. I do, I've done a lot of funerals and spoken at them. Yeah, you know, presided. Presided, right? Yeah, and there's a sacredness to that, and I'm interested in exploring what does this mean? Life after death, not so much about that, but maybe helping people transition and giving them comfort.

Because I have a firm belief that nothing will be lost when we die. Right. The body, but nothing that is held precious by source will be lost. So to kind of, I don't know, maybe that's a calling death to us, but I'm not sure that that's more the physical point. That's good. We have a whole category on that gap.

Firstly, we have a categorical index that you can go to under interviews, and there's a whole category for near-death experiences, other side, that kind of stuff. I think it's really useful. The reason I do those kinds of interviews, and I've been reading books about that kind of thing for a long time, is that I have a feeling that it really helps a person to understand that there is, just to watch interviews with people who have had near-death experiences, who are talking about this kind of thing, it expands your perspective and can totally change your attitude about dying, and can prevent suicide and things like that.

I mean, there are people who think, okay, I'll just kill myself, and that'll be the end of me, and all my problems will be solved. And then they do that, and they think, uh-oh, it didn't work out that way. Here I am still, and my problems are apparently are going to be worse because I did that. So it can really impact your life to have an understanding of this kind of thing.

Yeah, it is, I have listened to different, different ones. Sounds true, had a whole thing too. Yeah, so that, because maybe if we had a more expansive view of existence, we wouldn't be wasting our time destroying each other, you know. I'm not sure, but I just want to say, just one other thing is, you know, who or what we identify as makes all the difference.

So you were just saying that, if somebody believes, well, this is it. You know, I'm here in this, this body is me, this is it, when I die, that's that. But we're going to act a different way with we identify as part of source, where, you know, there's, there's something afterwards, you know, we're, we're, we're, we can't be separated from it.

You know, how was that going to be to be not separate without form? And so that is a thing that next stage of consciousness that I'm kind of like really interested in is, is how not to identify how we do now, because there is such a pull of gravity for identity. Yeah. And in how we identify, like, we create that makes all the difference.

So that's part of consciousness too, but that's like, you know, one part of it, but it's, it fascinates me how we, you know, the difference it can make on how we identify. They really change what we are. I appreciate this more and more, how, how just even understanding has a profound impact on your whole perspective and your whole orientation to life.

And that's why it's good to keep culturing and understanding reading things and listening to things. And, and so on. Keep, keep exploring, you know, keep learning. There's, it makes life more interesting and can really enhance it. Yeah. Thank you very much. Yeah. Is there any final quote or nugget that you want to leave people with?

It could even be something you already said. But is there any kind of closing statement you'd like to make? Oh, okay. So, you know, when I had that vision of just the white lines and this, there was space in between. They don't actually touch. That's because, you know, everything is a relationship, you know, because in the no self, you know, kind of getting into the no self.

But, you know, there's nothing really there. Obviously, it's all about relationships. And so when I was thinking that it came to me, I said, yeah, you know, love, which, you know, God is love. Essence of creation is love. Love wanted to love. And so that's why there was the big bang in us. Because it wanted to have a relationship.

Yeah, I think that's beautiful. That's non duality is within, I mean, duality is within non duality. And, you know, and to me, I was like, I love that so much better. The big bang. And it's also kind of risky. But, and, and, you know, that, that, what came out of it, the universe, us, the stars, everything, because there's a relationship.

And it also matches what, what, what, the words I was giving, that code, Patrick, you know, I am aware in this that allows the sun to be aware of the moon. You know, we think we're the only things that have consciousness. We, you know, we don't know. Yeah, I think every, I think, I don't like the word have consciousness.

I think everything is consciousness and things reflect consciousness to varying degrees. They don't possess it, but they reflect it. And you and I ultimately have the same consciousness, but we each are reflecting it differently. And the plant behind you is reflecting it in a different way. And so on. And consciousness is not just plain vanilla consciousness.

It's also imbued with intelligence. It's that intelligence, which is, you know, orchestrating every of the trillions of cells in our bodies and in those plants and, and so on. It's, anyway, I'm getting off on a rant. But, yeah, no, I understand what you're saying. But I'm just saying we don't know whether there's intelligent consciousness within the sun.

I mean, the sun is a servant to, to the galaxy, you know, we don't know whether there's consciousness there or not. I think there's consciousness everywhere. Yeah. Well, every rock, every, everything, it's the most fundamentally it's there. Yeah. That was kind of what I experienced, but, but I'm talking like the sun being conscious of itself, I guess is.

Yeah. Some people, well, you mentioned you had watched my interview with Richard Lawrence a few weeks ago, maybe. And he was talking about how in his organization, they believe that there's life on every planet. It's just not gross biological life, which obviously couldn't live on Venus or someplace like that.

But at subtler levels, there are, there's life beings who live on Mars, Venus, the sun, every place. And this kind of mirrors what's other ancient traditions talked about when they regarded the, it seems like primitive that we think, oh, they thought the sun was a god. But no, there was something more profound than that that they may have been realizing, which is that, you know, this fusion reaction that we call the sun on a subtle level is there's an intelligence that is embodied in that, in that phenomenon.

That's, that's, thank you for saying that because that's kind of what I was getting at, but I couldn't quite articulate it. Yeah. You know, so, because I, I don't know why those particular words came to me, I never would have, you know, put it, but then when I heard it, I was like, yeah, that's beautiful.

That's good. That was one of the things that jumped out most of me at me in your book, was that phrase when you said, I thought, yeah, I love that. All righty, well, let's wrap it up. Yeah, thanks a lot, Karen. Good to meet you and stay in touch. And thanks to those who are, who have been listening or watching some interesting interviews coming up, including Swami Sarvapinanda in December, one of my favorite dudes.
