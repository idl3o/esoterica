## Transcript

And I think what I would like to do is to talk about the actual physiological mechanism of Kundalini in the body, because this is something you will not find on any website. You will not find it in an organized fashion, a Gopi Krishna's books is kind of spread around bits and pieces all over the place.

The only book that it existed is Consciousness of the New Paradigm. And what I did was I collected together all of Gopi Krishna's statements about the process and I put it into a narrative that explains it. There are two aspects of the Indian spiritual tradition which Gopi Krishna said must be incorporated into modern science before science will be able to understand Kundalini's voices failing on me.

One of these is Prana, the life energy, and the other is the, I guess you could say that consciousness is a higher order of reality than the physical creation. Now Prana, anyone who's done yoga seriously has heard of Prana Yama. This is the absorption of Prana into the body through the breath. Now what is it that's in the air that we breathe?

There are basically two elements. The majority of it is nitrogen, but nitrogen in its atmospheric form is extremely inert. Oxygen is very different. It is a terrific catalyst, you know, catalyzing other reactions. And Gopi Krishna speculated that there may be some kind of subatomic particle associated with the oxygen atom, which attaches to it.

Now oxygen is taken into the body through the belongs and oxygen atoms are distributed to every living cell in the body because cells like the body as a whole, they have to have oxygen in order to survive. He said, all the cells of the body extract this pranic energy from the oxygen atoms, and the cells themselves become kind of like pranic batteries, it's like a battery holds electric charge, but our cells of our body hold a pranic charge and it's continually being replenished by the oxygen.

The next stage of this process is that this pranic essence, this is my term, I call it a pranic essence, is taken from the cells of the body by the nerves and is transported to two different locations in the body. One of these locations is the brain. And in his definition of prana, Gopi Krishna said, it is an extremely subtle as yet undiscovered by science, an extremely subtle substance, which is responsible for the activity of thought and transference of impulse and sensation and living organisms.

In other words, without this pranic fuel in our brains, we couldn't think. So of course science does not believe in this, but science has a lot to learn about the brain. So part of this pranic energy goes directly to the brain, but it's only carried to the brain by a very limited number set of nerves. The majority of this pranic essence collected from the cells of the body by the nerves goes to the reproductive system, and it is stored in the fluids, specifically in the fluids of the reproductive system.

Now I know that there are physiological differences between males and females, and Gopi Krishna described it as a parallel process. It accomplishes the same thing, even though the physiology may be different. So the secretions in the reproductive organs are like the major storehouse of this pranic essence in the body.

Now this pranic essence could be used in two different ways. One is for sex and reproduction, and this pranic essence is really what is behind the pleasure we feel in sexual arousal and orgasm, without that essence we wouldn't have that pleasure. And also stated that he believed that it was essential for insemination as well, maybe the wiggly sperms, but he made that point that it's necessary for insemination.

So that is the one purpose that this pranic essence could be used for, and he said that when it's used for this purpose, it is converted from the essence in the reproductive system into a gross form, which is maybe necessary for it to produce that sensation of pleasure. I'm not sure. Other purpose that this pranic essence is needed for is spiritual transformation.

Now here's a major misconception, major misconception that so many people have about Kundalini. When somebody says, I'm going through an intense Kundalini process right now, I think what most people where their mind goes is what's happening at the base of the spine, you know, is just shooting this energy up the spine through the chakras and all that.

When I hear somebody say that where my mind goes is what's going on in their brain because the awakening of Kundalini is more about the, I guess, the activation of what Gopi Krishna called this an evolving center in the brain. He actually described it physically as above the palate and below the crown of the head and slightly back towards the back of the head.

He said near the fork ventricle, but I'm not sure what that is, I'm not an analyst. He described that. It's a very small region in Sanskrit. This is called Brahma Randra, the chamber of Brahma. It's referred to as a chamber of Brahma because Brahma is the creator deity and it's creating this new faculty of perception.

So when you meditate, what organ of the body is it stimulating the brain? So what happens is when this center when the brain starts to become active, what it does is it sends signal down to the reproductive system and says start sending that energy up to the brain because when the center becomes active, it's somewhat similar to if you take a hundred watt light bulb out of a lamp and you put it in a 200 watt light bulb, it's going to give you double the amount of light.

However, it's going to draw double the amount of current from the electrical system. So when this center in the brain starts to become active, it instantly must have far more pranic energy than the nerves will provide that person in a state of normal consciousness has. So it tells the reproductive organs start producing this stuff.

And this, these pranic essence in the reproductive organs is sublimated into, it gets very complicated. There's actually two things that get created. But let's just say there's one just for the sake of simplicity that it sublimates it into this refined, what is called in Sanskrit, OJAS, OJAS, which is sent up the spine to the brain.

And it is essential for the brain to have this pranic essence in order to function properly because if it doesn't get that, then all sorts of neuroses and psychoses and problems can happen. So it's the center in the brain that is triggering the center at the base of the spine, not the reverse, which most people think.

And if you remember, Gopi Krishna's initial awakening experience, he sat there meditating for three hours a day, and he would picture this lotus shining above his head, going with light. And he was meditating one day, and all of a sudden he felt this intensely pleasurable sensation at the base of the spine.

So his attention went from the lotus to the base of the spine, the sensation disappeared. So he managed to calm himself down and bring his attention back to the lotus. Again, the energy started to come up as soon as he took his attention off of the lotus, the energy went back down. The third time he managed to bring the energy all the way up to the brain.

But this is a clear indication that it's the center in the brain, which is really what is triggering the activity at the base of the spine. And in terms of understanding a Kundalini process, it's really essential to understand this mechanism.
