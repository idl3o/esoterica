## Transcript

So, if you are also interested to be the part of our team, then you can contact us on the even contact number, oblitions, they are the core technology which means sitting near each work to get knowledge. There are 108 wishes and Manu's wishes is Manu's wishes. The theme of Manu's wishes is an exposition of mystic cerebellum with a few of training the mind in meditation for the purpose of achieving freedom gradually.

So that, into which we are doing so, it is assumed that I will be ready. Who am I? Am I a physical character, emotional character, intellectual character or something very deeper? Then how we come from where I am going? These are all the questions that open to us, who is spiritual discovery. We open it so much harder when, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's.

So, let us embark on this journey of revealing, I have provided, we are pointing to Manu, Manu, the opening. Switch off, switch off. Now, I request Swapiji, Swami Saranthi and Anandaji Maharaj to come forward and enlighten us with the thoughts on our original journey. Good evening and I am back again, this time with a very different subject.

Subject today is this most ancient of questions, who am I? And we will investigate this subject, this question in the light of the open issues this evening and tomorrow again at the same time. So, this is the question we will be looking at. Vedanta is basically the teachings of the open issues. Vedanta is basically the teachings of the open issues, Vedanta, Nama, Upanishad Pramandam.

The definition of Vedanta is the philosophy based on the teachings of the open issues is Vedanta. I think most of you are familiar to some extent with Vedanta and the open issues. The open issues present the highest philosophical teachings of the Vedas, they are among the most ancient texts known to mankind.

There is a long list of open issues. In fact, in one of the open issues called Muktika open issue, we find a list of 108 open issues. But among all of these open issues, there are some 10 or 11, major within quotes, major open issues, major why major? Because Adi Shankaracharya, some 1200 or 1300 years ago, chose these open issues to write his commentaries Bhashim on these open issues.

And these open issues basically have become the central texts of Vedanta. So, the Vedanta movement, you see all over the world, these open issues have become the source texts. Shankaracharya interpreted these open issues in a non-dualistic fashion. So, his teaching is called Advaitha Vedanta. That is the context in which we will be discussing today.

Among all the open issues, especially among these major open issues, there is one open issue, which is regarded, which is the smallest of all the open issues. And also regarded as the toughest, and that is called the Mandukya open issue. There is a saying that, Mumukshunam, Vimukta, Mandukya, Meva, Alam, for the liberation of those who want spiritual enlightenment, Mumukshu, those who want Mukti.

For them, the Mandukya open issue alone is sufficient. So, if you read this open issue and you are lucky enough to understand what it means and realize what it means as a living reality in your own life, you are free, you do not need anything else. So, for liberation, the Mandukya itself is sufficient for those who want liberation, for those who want Mumukshu or spiritual enlightenment.

It is the smallest open issue. The only 12 mantras are there in this open issue. It is found in the Atharva Vedas. You all know that there are four Vedas, Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharva Vedas. In the Atharva Vedas, you find this open issue. Among other open issues, you find this Mandukya open issue.

Only 12 mantras. So, it is like a small chile which is very hot. Sometimes, in Bengali, they say, Dhani longka, small chile which is very hot. In this Mandukya open issue, the most important mantra, the central mantra, central text is what you have in your hands. Now, they hand out the seventh mantra, the seventh mantra of the Mandukya open issue.

This is, in fact, the core mantra of the entire open issue of these 12 mantras. And this gives a direct answer. The highest possible answer that you can find in our scriptures in Vedanta. And I have not found any more sophisticated, more profound answer in any of the literatures of the world religions or philosophies which I have come across at least.

At least, I have not found myself nor has anybody reported anything more profound in this. So, when I was given an opportunity to talk to you, I decided what the heck? Let me go for the toughest text. Let us see what happens. We will take it up as a challenge. Normally, we do not use this in a general gathering.

It is usually reserved for those who have studied Vedanta for a long time. And only then you take up this one. But pay attention. And I think we will all derive a great deal of benefit from today's lecture and tomorrow's also. Tomorrow I will go further deeper into this text. The Mandukya open issue was commented upon by Gauda Pada Acharya.

Gauda Pada Acharya is the Guru of Shankaracharya's Guru. So, Gauda Pada Acharya's disciple was Govindapada and Govindapada's disciple was Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya. So, in Uttarakhand in Himalas, they say Guru or Dada Guru, grandfather like that, grand Guru. So, Shankaracharya's Guru's Guru was Gauda Pada Acharya and he wrote verses on the Mandukya open issue.

These verses are called Mandukya Karika. So, nowadays when you look at the Mandukya open issue, you usually find them in a book called Mandukya Karika. It includes the Mandukya open issue plus Gauda Pada Acharya's commentary on the Mandukya open issue in the form of verses called Karika plus Shankaracharya's commentary in prose, Sanskrit prose on the original open issue as well as the Karikas of Gauda Pada Acharya.

So, this is the book Mandukya Karika. It has four chapters. The first chapter incorporates the Mandukya open issue, the original text as well as certain commentaries given by Gauda Pada Acharya and this mantra is found in the first chapter in the open issue itself. It is the seventh mantra. We will come back to this at the end of the talk.

When I learned communication long way back before I joined the order, my communication teacher told me, you should start all talks with the story. So, I will start this talk with the story. About 10 years ago, in the Himalayas, in the high Himalayas in Gangotri, I was staying there for about a month, just like a traditional monk, no ashram, no school, college, Ram Krishna, nothing, just staying in a log cabin begging for my food in an Anakshetra and meditating and studying.

And the log cabin means not like this, there is no electricity, no furniture, nothing, just you know Rajaay Kumbhal on the ground there is a blanket and two or three blankets you can put on yourself and so dark in there at this time because you cannot go out, it is very cold and dark outside. Now, this they have electricity, but now it is even a mobile phones, they have put up a tower nearby, so you can signal there.

I saw that happening by the way. Anyhow, at that time it was so dark you know at this time in the cabin, it would be so dark that if I wave my hands before my eyes and I could not make out whether my eyes are open or closed, you cannot see anything. Only sometimes you can see sparks jumping out of your woolen clothes in static electricity from the completely comevel to your sweater and but anyway, so that was the situation.

One day after Bikshah, I was taking a walk with some of the monks there with whom I had made friends and this monk, he told me a story. So, you can see the setting in the Himalayan on the through the forest tracks, the Deodara trees are there, pine trees also and you go through that, you are taking a walk around 430 or 5, dinner is at 4 o'clock.

So, it is too dark afterwards and this monk told me a story, the story goes like this, Raja Janak, Janak Raja, one day he was asleep very peacefully sleeping and suddenly the sentry came running and said, I will use mixture of Hindi and English, but I will translate into English also because the story was told to be in Hindi.

Maharaja, you get up, get up, what happened? The enemy has attacked, we must fight a war. So, Janak Raja immediately got up, summoned his generals and his soldiers and he went off to battle, put on his armor and so on and everything, took his sword and everything and went off to battle and there was a fierce battle in which Janak Raja was defeated.

He was wounded, he was captured by the enemy, dragged before the enemy king and the enemy king said, I have captured your kingdom, now I will not kill you because you are a king, I will exile you, you get out of this kingdom, it is mine now. What could poor Janak Raja do? He was tired and exhausted and bleeding and depressed, somehow he started walking and people in what was his own capital earlier, they refused to give him water or food because they were afraid, the new king is very cruel, if they know we have helped you and he will punish us.

After walking for two days, he came to the border of his kingdom and he crossed the border to the next kingdom and he found, food was being served to poor people, beggars, so there was long line and nothing they were serving rice or kichori or something, in a big handa was there. So, he joined that line and as he advanced in the queue when he came up to the place where it was being served, at that time it was finished, no more food and he could not take it anymore, you know he was feeling terribly depressed and tired and exhausted in pain and that person was giving food.

He said just this torch which is lying at the bottom of the handa, that is there I will give it to you if you want it. So, he gave me that and he gave him a bowl filled that torch in there and gave it to him, before he could lift it trembling to his lips, a kite chile, the circling up there, it dived and hit that bowl, knocked it out of his hands and that bowl went rolling in the dust and whatever was they were spilled in the dust and Janakras could not take it anymore, you know he was so overcome with misery and sadness, he fell down on the ground, ha ha kar kartevi as he said, the sadhu ha ha kar kartevi ha ha kar in Sanskrit ha kar in Hindi ha kar, not English ha ha.

So, just it means just the opposite and when he was crying alas, suddenly heard a voice, Maraji kawa, what happened sir and he woke up, he is just pounding covered in sweat sitting on the bed and the sentry has come, Maraji shouted, what happened? So, it was a dream, the whole thing was a dream a nightmare, nothing has happened, but because Janakras was very, you know he had a very analytical mind.

So, he looked up and he said, oh such a yes such is that true or is this true, is that dream true or is this waking world is it true, oh such a yes such sentry was taken back, what is this, they called the minister, sir what is wrong, was such a yes such, you called the queen, the queen thought that old man, what has happened to you, his wife came, what happened to you, was such a yes such, this is only one thing he is saying, was such a yes, nobody could understand this.

Next day in the morning in the market place, it is already in trick problems, people are walking in hush hush and ashtavakramuni, the great Ghani, he is walking, he has come to the city and he heard, this is what is happening, he was a Ghani, so he knew what has happened, he decided I will go and visit Janakraja and he went to the court and he asked Janakraja, Janakraja, how are you, and Raja said, both such a yes such, that is what is doing all day sitting in the court surrounded by the queen and the ministers and the armed and the generals and everything and I am, I am sort of imagining, this is not part of the story but I am imagining, you know the officers coming with files, please sign, was such a yes such, no work is getting done, when he said this to ashtavakramuni, same thing, was such a yes such, now ashtavakramuni knows what he is referring to, so he said, Janakraja, when you were rolling in the dust, bleeding, tired, defeated, depressed, crying on that ground, what he is referring to only Janakraja knows and he knows, nobody else understands, what is this defeat and all this, at that time was all this there, your power, your wealth, your queen, your generals, your minister, all these things were there or not, Janakraja said no, none of this was there, only defeat and depression and sadness and misery.

And now you are sitting here in the court surrounded by your, your courtiers and all this power and wealth, that defeat, that depression, those wounds, that terrible situation, is it here, the king said no, it is not here, no, not here, then ashtavakramuni said, to Raja, now yes such, now oh such, neither this is true nor that is true, this was not there in that terrible dream and today you are in this situation, you are calling it a dream, that is not here, then Janakraja was shocked, the next question which would come to all of us, he is saying to Kuchbhi Sachni, is it nothing true then, then the Muni said, when you were there, on that battle, on that place where you are rolling in the dust, defeated, crying, where you there or not, tabwa, abtheyani, did you see that or not, yes I was there, I saw that, that may be false, but I have experienced it, it may be false, I woke up and I say it is false, but I have experienced it, or either up, you are now sitting in the court, either be abtheyani, are you sitting here and experiencing this or not, he says yes I am experiencing it, to Raja, now yes such, now oh such, but tum he such, neither that is true nor this is true, but you the witness of both situations, you alone are the truth, this is a story, the rest of the lecture we are going to struggle with this concept and try to understand what is the meaning of this story, the meaning of this story and the meaning of this mantra are exactly the same, but we will see, we will try to understand it, at least intellectually let us get a grasp on what they are saying, whether you will be convinced or not, that comes later, but understanding comes first, what he is saying is I, who am I, the ego, you can put it this way, it is a jumbo duster, you can call it the knower also, knower, is it visible or it is too small, do small, okay I will write a little large, now you have the waker, Janak Raja when he was awake, you all of us, we are the waker now, we are in the waking state, hopefully some may be drifting off and this waker, what does he or she, what does he experience, the waking world, I am just giving this name, the Sanskrit name would be Jaagrath Prabhansha, so the Sanskrit term is Prabhansha, in Hindi also we say Prabhansha, yes Prabhansha, the term comes from Pansha, Pansha means 5, the idea was there are 5 elements out of which the world is constructed, Prabhansha, Prabhansha, Prabhansha by the elaboration or mixture of these 5, then the universe is constructed, anyhow the general idea is Prabhansha, so the waker sees this waking world and when Janak Raja was dreaming or when we dream, he was the dreamer and he sees a dream world and there is another state which we all go through, where we are neither awake nor dreaming, absolutely in deep sleep, no dreams are there, even modern science accepts it, neuroscience also says that is dreamless sleep, one is REM sleep you can talk about rapid eye movement sleep and the one is dreamless sleep, so this dreamless sleep we can call it the sleeper, not the railway sleeper, this is the sleeper, the one who has who is in deep sleep and we cannot say a sleep world, we can say a sleep, a sleep world would be sleep blankness, what do we experience in deep sleep nothing, just blankness, even I am sleeping that kind of a thought also is not, no thought at all, so we can call it a sleep blankness, what this Upanishad tells you is that you are not the waker, you are not the dreamer, you are not the sleeper, what you are the real you is a fourth, is the fourth state which is called Turyaam or Turya, do not be scared about this term, Turya simply means number four, that is all, Turya means four, Chaturtham, the mantra here does not use the word Turyaam, that word was introduced later by Gauda Paathacharya in his commentaries, but the word mantra uses the word if you will notice Chaturtham, fourth and Turyaam, this is all that the mantra is trying to tell you, all that Astava Kramuni was trying to tell Janakaraja, that what you saw the defeated Janakaraja in the world where he was defeated, he was expelled from his kingdom, he was suffering in the neighborhood kingdom and lying on the ground and all the circumstances of that world, the dream world and he who was dreaming there, both are not real, but there is a fourth one who was watching that, right now you are the waker, I am the waker, this is not our real nature, but there is a fourth who is watching this waker and the waking state, illuminating both and similarly in dream state, this is the basic idea, I will explain it with the help of an example, what is the reality, the reality or the real you answer to this question is who am I according to this mantra is you are the Turya, the fourth, it is like role number one, role number two, role number three and role number four, the Upanishad begins with this statement, Soyam, Atma, Chattushpa, who am I, you have four aspects, you have four aspects, the Upanishad begins in the first mantra, the four aspects are these four, among these four aspects three are false, one alone is real, three are false, one alone is real.

Now the interesting thing is, Upanishad says this is real, this is who you are, answer to the question, who am I, but we are not aware of anything like this, if you talk about the waker and the waking world, we are aware of that, this is what we know, what we are right now experiencing, you are the waker, Mr or Mrs.

Soyam or Mrs. Soyam or Swami Soyam so, experiencing this classroom, this is the waker experiencing a waking world, this is what this is, and when it tonight I will go and sleep and dream, I have certain experiences, I will be in that dream also, then I am the dreamer, I have experiencing a dream world, and when I go into deep sleep, blankness, nothing, absolute blankness, there you can call it the sleeper and experiencing a sleep blankness, remember the sleeper for example, the sleep there is no external world, no physical body, no mind, nothing, just blankness, that is from a subjective point of view, be careful, this is your own experience, this is not an objective experience, for example, somebody I remember once, Swami was talking about it and he is saying in the deep sleep, which is called the Sushupthi, in deep sleep there is no experience of the world, there is no body, no mind, only a blankness, then somebody in the audience asked, what do you mean there is no body and mind, in the mosquito net we are under that we can see the fellow is sleeping, 80 or 90 kilos nicely snoring, how come there is no body you are seeing, from objectively from your point of view, but you look at it from the person's point of view, who is asking this question, who am I, from his own experience, your own experience, in the deep sleep daily we experience this, that no experience of world, no experience of body, no experience of mind also, even the thought I am sleeping that is not there, if you say I am sleeping then you are not sleeping, it is not deep sleep, so that is state we all experience and apart from it, they talk about a Turya, a Turya whichever, the fourth, how what we to understand this, these three we can understand, but this one is not very clear, what is this one, let us look at it this way, suppose we have an ornament made say a bracelet or a bangle and necklace and ring, somebody tells you these are all golden ornaments, somebody tells you these are just names and forms, the reality is the gold, the reality is the gold, it is a golden bangle golden necklace or golden ring, but the reality is not the bangle necklace or ring, the real substance is gold, and there is an interesting story about this, one said G, whose business was not going well, he went to take some loan, you know, Girvi Rakhna, so he took his Ganesha and put it in the pawn shop and said he give me some loan and the jeweler he weighed it and he said Ganesha's carrot, this is the rate, this is the rate at which I will purchase the Ganesha statue or I will take, I will give so much money for that.

And you know Ganesha's wahan is there, the mouse, the Chuha and the jeweler also weighed that and gave the same rate, said he was furious, what are you up Ganesha's jeweler, Chuha here it, how is it possible, then the jeweler said, Ariseha, Abh, Abh, Ganesha Chuha, I am only the sonai, I will, I see it as gold, so I am weighing the gold and giving you the rate of that, so the gold is the reality, the substance, now if somebody tells you a person who does not understand what gold is, tells that person that it is not a bangle, bangle necklace and ring are just the names and the forms and the functions, you know, bangle is something you put here and it is called a bangle, necklace is something you put here, it is called a necklace, ring is something you put in your fingers, it is called a ring, but the substance, the reality of all of them is gold only, now suppose a person does not understand what gold is, his idea will be that there is something from reality called gold apart from all of this, if he throws away all of this and starts searching for gold will he find it, no, he will not find it, there is no gold apart from these, but if he thinks this is gold, what will happen, the moment somebody comes and melts the bangle down and makes a necklace out of it, he thinks the bangle itself is the gold, when that goes away and is melted down, what will you think gold is gone, gold is gone, he does not understand the new form which has come necklace is the same gold, it is the same gold in another new form with a new name and a new function, when that necklace is also melted and put into a ring, it is the same gold with a new name, with a new form and a new function, but the physical reality is the same, similarly the idea here is the waker and the dreamer and the waker and the dreamer and the sleeper, the reality is that you are the witness of all three states and you are in and through these states, the idea is that that there is no fourth separate reality called Turium, it is the same reality which is now being called a waker in the waking state, it is the same person, same reality, same consciousness which will be called a dreamer in the dream state, it is the same reality which will be called the sleeper in the sleep state, what is the difference between these states, here we have a we are in a physical body with a sense organs, we are interacting with a physical world and this is the waking state, so waking state as there is a great preponderance of the physical body and interaction with the physical world through the sense organs with the enrias.

So, here the term they use is Bihichitta, extroverted consciousness, consciousness which is flowing out into the world, the dream world, they are very common sensical, the Vedantins, they know the dream world is simply constituted out of our experiences in the waking state, so when I go to sleep, whatever I have experience in the waking state throughout my life, those elements are taken together, made into a kichidi and comes out as a dream, so there is a dream world which is constructed out of the mind, the physical body is not active there, it is only when we wake up, we realize the physical body was sleeping, but I went to Delhi and I did so many things there and came back and when a woke up I was in IIT Kanpur, but I physically I did not go to Delhi, that body was lying there under the mosquito net in the hostel, wherever, so the dream world is entirely made of the mind, so there they say that the term they use is antapragm, where consciousness is directed in words, working only in the mind, not externally in the world.

And the sleeper deep sleep, no experience is there except that blankness, when we wake up we say that I did not know anything, I slept like a log of wood, no external consciousness, no dreaming also, very peaceful sleep I had, that is what we say, when we wake up from deep sleep, so the deep sleep is a state of absolute blankness and the term they use in Vedanta is Pragyana Ghana, all these terms will come, Pragyana Ghana means a mass of consciousness, mass in the sense there is nothing for consciousness to illumine, there is nothing for consciousness to illumine, it just remains in blankness, all the external world, the dreams everything is pushed into a mass which is not expressed which is not experienced there, in a potential state it is there, why do you say it is in a potential state, because the next moment when you wake up everything is back again, here is the IIT campus and your responsibility is at the same body and the same people all around, so everything is back again into your life, so it is in a sort of potential state in a dream state, so all of these according to the Mandu kaupanishad, they are not the reality, they are not the reality, their reality is the consciousness in all of them, what they are saying is this, just like gold is apart from all of them and yet in and through all of them, how is it apart from all of them, when bangles goes and it is made into a necklace, so bangles, necklace is not a bangles, necklace is not a bangles, bangles is not a necklace but both are gold only, similarly when the necklace is transformed into a ring, the ring is not a necklace, necklace is not a ring but both are gold only, so gold is apart from bangles in the sense that when bangles goes and is made into a necklace, gold survives, when necklace goes and is made into a ring, gold survives, so gold is there in all of them, they are apart from each other, similarly the waker is apart from the dreamer, the dreamer is apart from the waker, but there is something continuing in both of them, that is the theory of the fourth one, similarly the dreamer is apart from the sleeper, the sleeper is apart from the dreamer, but you own up all of us, we own up, it was my dream and it is my deep sleep and it is my waking, who is that one who is saying it is my waking, my deep sleep, my dream, that one is the consciousness which is apart from the waking self, apart from the dreamer self, apart from the sleeper self and yet in and through all of them, so that this torium, the reality is right now here, it is here now, but it is not exactly this mystery or misses, so and so, what is added to the torium or the circumstances of the waker, it goes like this, just like gold you have consciousness, just see, you are aware of this class now, after before this this class was not there, something else was there in your life, now this class is going on, after sometime this class will be over, something else will come, you may be will go back to your hostel or your house, so a new circumstance will come, in all cases what happened before, what is happening now, what will happen later, you are the consciousness watching all of them, the circumstances are coming and going, look at your own body, you see yourself as a young person or a middle aged or an old person, remember the same consciousness was watching when you are a 10 year old kid, when you are 20 years old, what you are now and to the same consciousness which will be watching when you are much older, so the body is changing continuously, the consciousness which watch is the same, how can you say it is the same, because it is our experience, we own up to it, I was the one in the 10 year old's body, I am the one in the teenagers body, I am the one in this middle aged body, so who is this continuous I, because the body is changing, body is continuously changing, similarly the mind is also changing, imagine your mind when you are in say class 10, you sitting for your class 10 examination, why I am saying class 10 because everybody remembers the class 10 board exams, and the first big board exams which you had to face, so imagine your mind at that time, what you knew, what you did not know, what you liked, what you did not like, what you wanted and just imagine compare it with your mind now, you know so many things more, your likes and dislikes have changed, what you want in life has changed, so the mind is also continuously changing but there is the same consciousness which was watching the mind of that class 10 student is also right here watching the mind of this IIT student now, so mind is a series of changes, consciousness is not changing, similarly every day, every day when we go from waking to dream, to dream, to deep sleep, when we go from waking to dream to deep sleep, consciousness is the same, see the world has changed, the waking world disappears in the dream world comes, a dream body comes remember the body which you have in the dream is different from the body of the waking world, why, because the waking world body is lying in the bed, but in the dream body you are doing so many things, it is a false body no doubt, but your experience is that you have a body there in that world, so consciousness is apart from the waking world and the waking body, consciousness is apart from the dream world and the dream body and consciousness is apart from the deep sleep blankness, it is in and through all of them, the states are coming and going and the ego associated with each state is coming and going, but the consciousness is illuminating all of them, the correct way to show this diagram would be the fourth one is not here, but the fourth one is here, torium or toria, it illuminates the wake or toria, it illuminates the wakeer, illuminates the dreamer, illuminates the sleeper and this is the only reality and this is the answer to who am I, the question is what are you or what am I, apart from this waking state, apart from the dream state, apart from deep sleep, apart from the physical world of the waking state, apart from the mental imagination of the dream state, state and apart from the blankness of the deep sleep state, one of our swamis is to tell this, give this example, station master sitting on the station maybe in Kanpur and the first Rajdhani express comes on the platform, platform number one or something Rajdhani express comes, so very important train lot of people are getting in and getting out so much of rush is there, so much activity, the station master watches then he gives the signal Rajdhani express goes away, but the station master does not go away with Rajdhani express, he is watching, then another train comes maybe a good train, no activity smokey, not many people and very few people, one or two people may be there, it comes and stops for some time, station master is watching, gives the signal the good train goes away, but the station master has not gone with the good train, he is on the platform watching, next what happens, no train is there, it is a blank platform.

The blankness is there, the station master is watching the blankness, now this is exactly what is happening, you the pure consciousness, you watch the arrival of the waking state just like Rajdhani express, so many hopes and aspirations and success and failure and problems, all of it comes with a body and with a world and you are watching, only thing is you get identified with the mind in the waking state and say I am Mr.

Swanson, this is my reality, these are my problems, these are my hopes, success and failure, these are my goals, after some time that disappears, you like the station master, this one you are watching, dream world comes with a dream body, with dream you know nice dreams and nightmares and all and so forth, you become identified with the dream body and dream mind and you go through this dream experiences, then that also goes away, blank platform, you are the consciousness watching the blank platform and again the waking state comes, Rajdhani express comes again, but you are apart from all of them, not only you are apart from all of them, you are untouched by all of them, you are untouched by all of them, the sufferings and enjoyment of the waking state, of the dream state and the blankness of the sleep state, none of them touch the pure consciousness which is apart from all of them, but it sustains all of them, in its light the entire game is illumined, this whole thing is illumined in its light, now we will quickly go through the verse and try to understand what they are trying to say, let me read out the verse once for you, then I will break it up and explain it, now you will see it will all become perfectly clear, the verse goes like this, the mantra goes like this, nantav pragyam nabhish pragyam, navayatav pragyam napragyana ghanam napragyam napragyam napragyam, adrishyam abhyevaharyam agrahyam alakshanam, achintyam, habhyepadeśyam, ekatma pratyasaram, prapanchyopasamam, shantam, shivam, adveytam, chatutam manyantesa atma savigeya, what does it mean?

Let me take you through this, there are three parts here, the first two parts, first part it denies that you are the waker, you say that you are not this waking person, you imagine yourself to be now, you are not the dreamer, you are not the sleeper also, there is the first part, the second part of it will deny, you are not this this Turiyam, the reality, real you, you are apart from this waking world, you are not this physical body of the world or anything to do with this world, you are apart from the dream world and you are apart from the blankness of the sleep world.

The third part will tell you that you are in and through just like gold is through all this, the third part will tell you, you are the consciousness which is watching all this panorama, this this game of the jagrat swapna and susupti. Let me read it out, first nantapragyam, now you can easily understand, nantapragyam literally means the inward directed consciousness, it means the dreamer, he says you are not the dreamer, nantapragyam, you are Turiyam, nantapragyam, the fourth one is not the dreamer, nantapragyam, you are not the waker, you are the Turiyam, you are your real nature is not the waker, which you imagine now all of us, this is our reality, we think I am Swami Sravapri and I am the standing here in this lecture hall number three in IIT Kanpur, this is my reality, he says no, you are the consciousness illuminating this temporary appearance in your consciousness, you are not the waker, nabhish pragyam, anything in between waking and dream sort of, now by atapragyam, you are not something in between also, in between consciousness, I think many students are familiar with this in between consciousness, you know after lot of maybe a long lecture, you will be tend to go into an in between consciousness, between waking and dream, so I have seen many times the notes that you take in that in between consciousness are very interesting, something the teacher is something that is coming from your subconscious mind, something the teacher is thing and a mixture of that will come in your copy, so you are not in between also, nothing in between, napragyanaghanam, who is the pragyanaghanam, the deep sleep, you are not this one also, you the Turiyam, pragyanaghanam, nabh, pragyanaghanam and napragyam, here the word pragyam is interpreted as, are you some kind of, you know God, omniscient God, Ishwaram, Bhagawan, napragyam, you are not that also, so this is the meaning of pragyam, napragyam, the last word, napragyam, sundi has been done, napragyam, what does that mean?

In that case, are you is my reality that I am not sentient, I am some jadavas to like a duster or a chak, is it, no not that also, so napragyam, you are not unconscious, you are not all knowing God, you are not the waking person, you are not the dreaming person, you are not the sleeping person, number one, Turiyam is none of these, number two, the second part starts, adrishyam, what is Turiyam?

Adrishyam, literally it means invisible but also means you can, it is something that you cannot see, you cannot hear, you cannot touch, you cannot smell, it is not an object of our five sense organs, sometimes people say, if God exists or apma exists, why cannot I see it? It is like saying, if the Higgs boson exists, why cannot I see it?

Because, it is not yogir, it is not a subject of your normal vision, you cannot see it that way, if it was, if there is an, you can say that there is no elephant in the room, why is there no elephant in the room, because I cannot see it, that is a perfectly correct statement, because if there was an elephant, you could have seen it, but if there is an Higgs boson, you cannot say, because I cannot see it, it is not there.

Similarly, here it says, the consciousness which you are, is not something that you can see or smell or touch, adrishyam, second abhyevahadhyam, it is not within transaction, transaction means usable, what we can see and feel and touch, what we can speak about, what we can use, that is, abhyevahadhyam.

Pure consciousness is not an object which can be talked about, seen, felt and used, it is not transactible, not, it is abhyevahadhyam, but remember, it is the ground, it is the source of all abhyevahad, without that none of this can occur, none of this can occur without the pure consciousness, which is illuminating all this, but it is itself abhyevahadhyam, agrarhyam, it cannot be grasped, which means, it is not a vishaya of the pancha, karmindriyas, you cannot hold it with your hands, you cannot walk to it in pilgrimage, you are going to Bhadrinath or Kedarnath, I am going to Thuriyam, you cannot walk to the Thuriyam.

And, so agrarhyam, alakshanam, this is a technical term, it means, it cannot be inferred, alakshana here means, the sign by which you infer something, you know, the road is wet, so what you inferred, there was rain earlier, so is there some such sign, in Sanskrit the classic example is Parvato Vandhima and Dhumath, there is fire on the hill, because I can see smoke, there is a relation between smoke and fire, so if I see the smoke, I can infer, there is fire, a lot of science is done like that, through some science and you infer a chain, but here this cannot be inferred, because there is no sign by which you can infer it, then achintyam, you cannot think about it, have you thought about it, then it is not Thuriyam, you cannot think about it, but remember the opposite also holds, whatever you think about is illumined by this Thuriyam, the fact that we are having a conscious experience is because of this Thuriyam, so you cannot think about it, achintyam, abhiyapadeshyam, it literally means, it cannot be named, it cannot be named, it takes some time to explain why it cannot be named, but it is very interesting, Shankaracharya, there goes into an exposition, where can be used language, where can be used language, there are five areas where language works and he shows in the Thuriyam, none of those five apply, I can tell you in brief, you can work it out for yourself, it goes like this, if you can use language, if there is some jati, some species, if some object belongs to a class, so it is a cow, why we know the characteristics of the class of cows, so this object is a cow, you match it with the set and you say it belongs to that set, but there is no set of Thuriyam, so it cannot be part of a class jati, the number second is Guna, by some quality, give me the red flower, how do you distinguish the red flowers from all these flowers by the quality of red, but you cannot say Thuriyam is, has got some quality because supposed to be near Guna, beyond all qualities, then you can use Kriya, call the cook, Shankaracharya uses this example, Pachaka, Pachaka is the cook, how did you use language there, by the function of that person, you are saying, call the driver, call the cook, but Thuriyam is Nishkriam, no activity, unchanging, so you cannot use Kriya there, Jati Guna Kriya, some one the relation, so call the teacher, who is a teacher, who is a relation of teacher and student, because of the teacher and student, there is a relationship between these two persons, father and son or whatever, but Thuriyam there is no relationship, because it is one unchanging reality, there is no second apart from it, all these appear in its consciousness, but they have no reality apart from it, just as Bangal, necklace and ring have no reality apart from gold, if you remove the gold, the Bangal disappears, if you remove the water, the wave disappears, if you remove the wood from this, the table disappears, similarly Thuriyam is the only reality, which is appearing in all these ways, so there can be no summon, the no relation between it and anything else, and finally there is convention, they call it Rudi, this person's name is Prakashya, why are you calling it Prakashya, just like that, it is just a name given by my parents that is person is called Prakashya or Hari or whatever, there also you cannot use that method of naming Thuriyam, because to name somebody you have to point out this person, it has to be pointed out apart from all other objects, this person from now on is called XYZ, but you cannot point out Thuria that way, so language cannot operate in the case of Thuriyam, and so up Vyaparasham, up to this part is the second part of the mantra, where you will see actually it denies that Thuria is any of this, the entire physical world, the entire dream world and the blankness of deep sleep, all of them are denied here actually, you cannot see it, you cannot touch it, you cannot infer it, you cannot think about it, you cannot speak about it, so all of this is denied, none of this is Thuriyam, and then the third party comes to, then what is Thuriyam, now it speaks about it in positive terms, he says, Aka Atma Pratyasaaram, Aka One Atma Ai, Pratyasa, the cognition, the feeling of I-ness, Saram, the essence, if you follow this eye feeling, you will come to Thuriyam, you know when Ramana Maharshi says, who am I, you practice that, it is this thing, Aka Atma Pratyasaaram, this is exactly what Astava Kramani told, Janakaraja, in the dream state, where you there, dream is false note out, but where you there, yes I was there, in this waking state now, or you there now, yes I am there, that is the Atma Pratyasa, eye feeling, the consciousness which is in the wakeer, in the dreamer, and even in the sleeper, which is illuminating the blankness of deep sleep, that consciousness is in and through all this, just like gold is in and through all this, and that is the Thuriyam, Aka Atma Pratyasaaram, it is a very extraordinary word, Atma Pratyasa, eye feeling, you follow that eye feeling, you come to a core which is the Thuriyam itself, Prapancho Prasamam, Prapancham means cessation, Prapancha is, these are Prapanchar, Jagrat Prapanchar, Sapna Prapanchar, so Shripti you cannot call it Prapanchar, but anyway, Prapancho Prasamam, what is the Thuriyam, where it is completely untouched by the trouble and the sorrows and the limitations of these three propanjas?

Shantam absolutely peaceful, ever undisturbed, there is no world there to disturb you, that is the reality, and Shivam, Shivam here means Ananda Swarupam, it is full of joy, Advaitham, non-dual, non-dual why, because there is nothing apart from Gaurya, just as gold is Advaitham with respect to Bengal, necklace and ring, ring is apart from necklace, necklace is apart from Bengal, but none of them are apart from gold.

In fact in all of them, what is the only reality, gold, why do you say it is the only reality, because if you remove the gold, they will not disappear, so with respect to these three gold is Advaitham, non-dual, there is nothing apart from gold in this, similarly with respect to our universe, three universes, waking universe, dream universe and the darkness of deep sleep with respect to them, Turiyam is Advaitham, they are not apart from Uthi Turiyam, in fact in that sense is a tremendous statement, if this is not apart from Uthi Turiyam, in that case, this waker is Uthi Turiyam and its entire waking world is actually Uthi Turiyam, in that sense, you are the world, you can actually the Advaitham declares, I am the world, Atme Vedam Sarmam, I am everything, I feel oneness with everything, just like in the dream world, you were there, many people were there, non-living things were there in your dream, but when you wake up, what do you say, it was entirely constructed from my own mind, that means whatever you saw in the dream was you, actually you, you are one with everything in the dream, you means the waker, you are one with everything in your dream, when you were dreaming, everything was generated from you, so you are one with everything, in the same way, in the waking world also, everything is generated from the Turiyam or projected in the Turiyam, so we are all one with all that we experience, in that sense, so Advaitham.

Last part, you can easily understand now, Chaturtham Manyante, people think it is the fourth, role number four here, they say Manyante, foolish people think there is something fourth, some gold apart from Bengal necklace and ring, some gold is there, but there is no Atma apart from these three, you have to look there itself, so the fourth one is not here, the fourth one is here, which is shining through these three, you have to examine the experiences in the waking state, in the dream state and the sleeping state, and for that you have to do it in the waking state, to examine the experiences of dream or sleep, you do not have to go into dream and sleep, you do not have to start sleeping, you have to look back upon those experiences and see what was common all through, what was common all through, it is not a fourth apart from all this, that is why says Chaturtham Manyante, Chaturtham literally means Turiyam, people think it is a fourth reality, but actually it is the only reality, because 1, 2, 3 are actually false, these three are not real, their appearances, their reality is fourth, there are not four things here, there are not four things here, there is only one thing, which is gold, it appears as Bengal sometimes, sometimes as necklace, sometimes as ring, the reality is gold, similarly the reality is the consciousness which we are calling the fourth Turiyam, it appears as the waker now, it appears as the dreamer, it appears as the deep sleeper, Chaturtham Manyante, who is this Turiyam, we are coming to the end, Sir Atma, Sir Atma means that is what you are, Atma means I, Atma literally means I, Atma does not mean a ghost or something Param Atma, nothing like that, Atma means I, Sir Atma, that fourth one is the answer to this question, which we started with who am I, who am I, this fourth one Turiyam, Sir Atma, now what do you do after all this, Sir Wigge, that has to be realized, not only listening about it in a class or reading about it in a book, but making it a living reality, one interesting thing you know Swami Vivekananda says, I will end with this, Swami Vivekananda says, he who runs away from the world to meditate and die in a Himalayan cave, searching for God, he has missed the way, he who plunges headlong into the luxuries of the world, he wants to enjoy the world, he too has missed the way, then what is the way, then what is the way, the way is to defy the world, to spiritualize your everyday life, that is what Swami Vivekananda says, now with this background, you can actually understand what he means, it is the pure consciousness which you are appearing as the waker now, but it is the same thing which in all beings, and it is the same thing which appears as the non-living world, and therefore, it is the same spiritual reality, which I am, which you all are, which all this is, in that sense we are one with the world, that is spiritualization of the world, when you open you should say is Ishaavas, Siamidam, Servam, you see God in all beings, this is how you see, this is the most profound and very sophisticated way of looking at it, which you find in the Mandukyopanishad, and therefore, if anybody, Swami Vivekananda says, if you leave all this and search for Turya elsewhere, it is like throwing up with the bangle necklace and ring and searching for gold, you miss the way, if you grasp hold of this waking world, this alone is real, and I am this one, then you are in trouble, because this one will slowly become old and sick, and die, this waking world is continuously changing.

Why do you think that the light better than the whole singular case, why do you think that, because I do not have that much inside it, but I still have the feeling that, because something is good, why so, why are the others there? See, there is certain predisposition within us, light better than darkness, if you say, we always experience ourselves as conscious beings, isn't it so, very word experience, experience itself includes, it is almost, it is almost, it is almost circular to say that, we experience ourselves as consciousness, because experience includes the fact that, there must be consciousness, otherwise, how will you experience?

So, our very nature is to be conscious, you have never been unconscious, you have never had an experience of unconsciousness, when you come out of, suppose you were unconscious, you come out of it, when you think back and you say, at that time was unconscious, but in unconsciousness, you do not experience anything, blankness.

So, you always experience your own self as consciousness, as a conscious being, now just extend it, light is very much like consciousness, physical light of course, is a good example for consciousness, why it illuminates? And we are just the opposite is darkness, which is an absence of light. So, in that sense, we like light, because it is very much according to our nature, another thing is, we always search for happiness, we always search for happiness, we try to avoid unhappiness, therefore, certain things which make us happy, we say they are good, we certain things which make us unhappy, we say they are bad, although things in themselves may not, may be quite neutral, they may not be good or bad as such, but the effect they are having on us is happiness and unhappiness.

Now, the whole idea here is, the self which I have discovered here, is beyond this happiness and unhappiness, the happiness and unhappiness are all within this waking world and the dream world. Yes, there is a question there. Yeah. Who is that clear, they have used anther threatening, banish threatening?

Yes, banish threatening. It actually, it should be banish threatening and they are spelling mistakes there, yeah. So, they have used in anther threatening, yeah. Actually, this is difficult to say, they will simply pass it off as R should be a prayoga, asha prayoga means asha means comes from the rishis.

So, you do not hold the rishis to the rules of Sanskrit grammar. So, you will find lot of times in open issues, in kain open issues, for example, you will find this use usage, te vidan chakara, te vidan chakara, they knew, but you know, you know Sanskrit grammar do you say, they should be te vidan chakruhu, they knew in plural, if te is there, it should be plural, vidan chakara is singular.

Now, the question is raised in kain open issue, how come, you are starting with plural and you end up the verb is in singular, this is a basic Sanskrit problem, but there you cannot touch it, because the idea is the shrutis, you should not use your grammar on the shrutis, you just leave it as asha prayoga, the translation would be roughly poetic license, poetic license, just like you would not hold a poet to the rules of grammar, here also, you leave it, you just leave it like that, yeah.

So, who is that, who do not, who has to know all this, because he does not have that, any of the samadhanavit, any of the other thing, true true, absolutely, this is a good question and I will deal with it tomorrow, when one of the karikas, I just give you one line answer, Godapad Acharya will take up this question, I think in the 17th or 18th karika, which will come in the second hand out, which we will get tomorrow, and the answer he gives is just now, quite apart from all this, we find ourselves ignorant, we do not know this, we are just reading about it, we do not feel that, but our reality now is that, we feel I am this one, this I do not know, I do not know myself as this, this ignorance I have about what, about detourium, I have an ignorance about detourium, and because of this ignorance, I imagine that, I am the waker, now in this state, I am the one, who has to realize myself as Turium, when I realize myself as Turium, I will realize that, there actually there was no waker or waking state separate from me, Godapad Acharya's answer, one sentence answer to that is, for the purpose of instruction, the relation between knower and known, in fact this is the exact word he use, Upadeeshath, for the purpose of teaching, the relationship is set up between Guru, Shishya, Shastra, and all of that is sublated, Bhaadhita, when you realize yourself as Turium, it is not that they will disappear, moment you realize I am Turium, suddenly, Sravapriya and the will disappear, the classroom will disappear, everything will go into a haze of white light, no, no, no, they will still be there, just like when you realize the blue sky, the blueness in the sky, actually the sky is not blue, you know the physics behind it, so it just looks blue, once you understand the physics behind it, you know fully well the sky is not blue, after that when you look up at the sky, what do you see?

Blue sky, similarly, here you will realize what is the Turium, this world will keep on appearing, your friends need not be scared, you know that if you realize the Turium we will all disappear, you will realize the background, just like once you realize this is gold, it does not mean the bangles will disappear or the necklace or the ring will disappear, you just know the reality behind it, that will come in the 17th or 18th Karaka, exactly this question is answered, yeah, any other question?

So, how the clear is separated from the all this thing? I will just finish that one, come to, yeah, the answer would be there is nothing behind the consciousness, because according to Advaita Vedanta consciousness is sub-procasher, it is like light, a tube light, which illuminates this hall, the hall is in darkness, when you switch on the tube light, the hall is illumined, now do you need one more tube light to illuminate that tube light?

You do not, the tube light illuminates itself and the hall, in the same way consciousness is self-illumant and it illuminates whatever comes in front of it. So, there is no, you do not have to posit one more consciousness, then you will lead to it leads to what is called Anavasthar regresses as ad infinitum and it goes with our experience also, when I am conscious I do not require one more consciousness to illuminate consciousness, but remember this consciousness is apart from the thoughts, one thought can be about another thought, a thought can be about the world and a thought can be about other thoughts also.

So, thoughts can be about other thoughts, that is what is called introspection, but this consciousness is not introspection. One, I will tell you one interesting question came, you have heard of Susan Blackmore, those who do research in consciousness studies in AI and all, she is a well known researcher.

So, she says this idea of self-consciousness I, it is nothing permanent, some spiritual people say I, this permanent I is there, no no, she says it just like the example, she gives is a refrigerator, when you open the door, there is a light. So, whenever you open the door, there is a light, but when you close the door, is the light there, actually because you know how a refrigerator is designed, so there is no light, there you know that, but we can never see it, unless you are a mechanic, when you open everything up, but whenever you open the door, there is a light and these people Susan Blackmore says that these people, they make a mistake, when they look in their minds, they see an I-ness, but the I-ness disappears.

Suppose, we are talking about flow yesterday, when you are in flow, in fact, the I feeling disappears. So, there is no permanent I, that is what she is saying, but she is making a fundamental mistake here, at the weight of Vedanta would say, what she is taking, the refrigerator light, that is not consciousness, that is the ahankara, the ahankara of the waker, the I, the ego here, the knower, this comes and goes, this also comes and goes, this also comes and goes, but the, what illuminates they are coming and going, the station master, that is, what is meant by 2DM here, pure consciousness.

See, in till today, in western thought, mostly in western psychology, even in neuroscience, they do not make a distinction between mind and consciousness, they do not make a distinction between mind and consciousness. Thoughts and consciousness supposed to be the same, in in western poetry philosophy, you will see soul means the mind, personality mind, soul that taken as one entity, but in Indian thought, not only a dwayther, consciousness or the atman is separate from the mind, and that is separate from the body, a tricotom as view of the human personality, body, mind and atman.

So, consciousness is apart from the mind, where this I may come and go, like a refrigerator light, this may come and go, she is right there, but what dwayther speaks about is not that I, speaking about the light which shines on that I, when the I is present, when the I is absent also. One more question, then we wrap up, I think today is going with little heavy, I sort of expected it to be heavy.

Okay, I will take up your question, yeah, go ahead. I know that I am not a dwayther, I am not a dwayther, I am not a dwayther, so I should be indifferent to all the emotions by happiness, sorrows or everything. Yes. I should just see emotions going in front of me. Yes, yes. So, why should I feel sympathy to work or why should I have a sympathy towards someone who needs my life?

I should not need. Yes, true. First of all, you would not kill him also, because you would be indifferent to your own emotions also. So, now, this is an interesting question, but the answer is also pretty straight forward. Now, you see, there are two ways of looking at this. One is, the thorium is apart from the waker and the waking world.

First of all, why are we identified with all this? The reason given in a dwayther is, because we are ignorant of the thorium. We are not aware of it at all. We are not aware of it at all. We do not understand it. We may read about it, but we do not feel it. When we are ignorant of something, error comes. This is a fundamental thing.

From Aggana or let us use English, from ignorance comes error, comes error. If I do not know that there is a rope in the darkness, the rope is there, a semi-darkness. So, what do I see a snake? So, I am ignorant of the rope and I am make the error, I think it is a snake. I am ignorant of myself as the untouched, unchanging pure consciousness.

And what I see in my, in front of me, the world, this body and mind. And I immediately identify myself with this mind. Mind is full of thoughts, happiness, sadness, desires, everything. And I go on like this. I become the waker. I become the waker. Now, this is one way of looking at it. So, the thorium is apart from the waker to answer your question.

Thorium is apart from the waker. If you are really apart from it, you ought to be indifferent to it. Or another way of looking at it is, it is the thorium itself which appears as the waker and the waking world. Just like in your dream, you appear as the dreamer and the dreaming world, the one who is sleeping and dreaming.

In his mind, he creates a dream and he is also himself in that dream. In fact, the entire dream, the people in that dream, the animals and the non-living things and he himself in that dream, all of them are not apart from his mind. He has actually become everything in that dream. And this states that this thorium itself is appearing as all this.

In other words, the thorium is one with all. Now, some Sadhakar, some spiritual giant may stress the oneness aspect of it. You will find in waker and the again and again and again. He says, you are one. We are one with the universe. It is not a rhetorical thing. You should feel one with the universe, which is good.

But he states it as a fact, as an assertion. Actually, you are one with the universe. If you limit yourself to this body and mind, you are separate from all bodies and minds. But if you see what is behind that, like gold, then you are one with everything made of gold. Gold is one with everything made of gold.

You will see yourself as pure consciousness in yourself. All these things are taking place. Then you have a sense of oneness with all beings. If you stress that oneness, then the unhappiness of a person, the misery of another person actually will bring a response in you. Just as right now, my misery brings a response in me when I have Sarvatma Bhava, the oneness with everybody.

It automatically does. And you see it in the lives of great Sadhakar and great spiritual giants. They respond to the life, to the sufferings of others. But you are right. There may be a kind of spiritual giant who does not respond. Who may not be cruel, but may simply be indifferent to the world which he will see as a dream.

So there have been such people. And they have also been very great spiritual people also. You can see it in them, a kind of deep peace and joy is there within them. If somebody comes in front who is suffering, they will help. And that has been explained in different ways. There were a simple explanation would be, these people have gone through a long period of spiritual practice.

And so the mind of that person is suffused with thoughts of good thoughts, helpful thoughts. After realization, when he sees himself apart from all, what would he do? He would let the body and mind go on doing whatever, like a inertia of motion. So the inertia of motion of a sage would be to help others.

He is apart from the helping also. He sees himself as illuminating both the helper and the helped. This here we are really going to the peak of the Everest here. The final word, the Upanishads have to say about this. And I have packed so much into one class. I was seeing the explanation given by a very senior Swami.

I have given you just four or five points here, the whole one hour session. That Swami, he explains this verse in 127 points, out of which I have given you less than 10 percent today. So if there are seem to be gaps, it is very natural. If you think it is all perfectly clear, then you either realize all or you have not been following what is going on.

There should be some gaps actually. There should be some areas of confusion or you know, where you can feel it little uneasy about what is going on here. Should we wrap it up? Tomorrow, I am going into the extensions of this month of what, the implications. And go to Padacharya's, karikas will take up 7 or 8 karikas, which in the second hand out which will come tomorrow.

Thank you very much. Tomorrow, 11 to 12 here, here. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
