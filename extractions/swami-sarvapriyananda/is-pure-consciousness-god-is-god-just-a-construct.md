## Transcript

Hi, my name is Shaheen, I have two questions, but it depends on the first answer. So regarding the first two questions from the internet, you explain that the pure consciousness so and God. So is pure consciousness, consciousness God? Yes, I, is pure consciousness God, yes and no, I have, I'll make, it's not very difficult to understand, just as Vedanta would say pure consciousness is shine, but there's a distinction between the two.

The distinction is pure consciousness by itself is not Shaheen, it's pure consciousness with an overlay of the mind and personality and this, this body is called Shaheen right now. So Shaheen is a person, pure consciousness is impersonal, but you cannot exist, Shaheen would not exist without that pure, pure consciousness, that's your core reality.

Similarly, God can be personal, Atman, Brahman, Nidgun, Brahman is not a person, it's an impersonal principle, God, God can be an is in fact worshiped in the great world religions as a personal God. Somebody who, some reality which will respond to our prayers, which can intervene in human affairs, which can, which in fact is responsible for the creation, maintenance and ultimate dissolution of this universe.

So beginning and end of all affairs here in this world and it's always available to us as a loving, beneficient, protecting power, there's a person, a divine personality. So this is the difference. In Vedanta there are these two terms, Nidgun, Brahman, Saguna, Brahman, Brahman literally means the vast, we can call, loosely call it God, Nidgun, Brahman, the impersonal absolute which is pure consciousness, pure being, pure bliss, Satchidhananda.

Saguna, Brahman, Brahman with attributes, is with personality, is the creator, preserve a destroyer of the universe, all powerful, all knowing, merciful, beneficient, benevolent, the God of all religions, and they are two are not different, they are the same. Yes, that's why you call them Bhagwan and then they refer, oh I see God in you.

So it's just for us to understand, that's why they use those phrases. No, it is not just for understanding, it's real. Bhagwan, Ishwarah Bhagawan is the Lord, Ishwarah is God, it's real. Just as shine as a personality is real, it's not that God is a mental construct, just for us to understand, ultimately the pure consciousness alone is real and everything else is a mental construct.

You can say that, if you can regard shine, this body, this universe as a construct, then you can dismiss God as a construct, but we cannot do that, what generally happens is when I say, is it just for us to understand, is it a mental construct, is it a concept? God, is it a concept? What do we mean by that?

I am real, and my cookie is real, but God is a construct, not in that sense. In the sense that the world is real, in the sense that this body and personality and whatever you like in this world is real, in that sense God is also as much real, as much real as everything else is, but in that case, this Nirgunabrahman, this pure consciousness what we are talking about Brahman, the ultimate absolute is a greater reality, that's why Vivekanth is said, don't say from falsity to real, say from lower truth to higher truth.

But there are so many multiple names, so it's our own construct, right? There are so many multiple names, so that must be our construct, again, yes and no, yes because those names are given by us, those names are realized by us, those names are utilized by us, names and forms, in Hinduism you have multiple forms, those names are utilized by us to connect with the divine, in that sense yes, it is given by us, but again, it's not imagination, the reason by so many names are given, so many forms are there, so many concepts are there about God, is because God is to use the word capacious, limitless, and the spiritual seeker who approaches God through any of these paths, realizes God in that way and reaffirms once again the truth of God in that aspect, so Saddam Krishna said like an ant approaching a mountain of sugar, and it takes one little grain and with difficulty pulls it back to its little home and looks back and says, I'm going to come back for all of it, it won't, it can't and it need not, one grain of sugar is enough to fill the tiny little tummy of the ant, similarly for us, any one of these aspects enough, Saddam Krishna said, where peace you find peace, that is the end, so all of these aspects are true, try any one of those aspects in whichever religion, do it sincerely, hold on to it for some time, few years, if you do at least sincerely, if you do faster few months, it'll become clear to you, it's real, only don't be fanatical about it, this is the only reality, what happens is sometimes sincere spiritual seekers become fanatical, because as they sincerely progress along that path, it becomes more and more real and then they feel, this is the reality, why are all those fools thinking about God in all those different ways, but those are also real, if you would try in that way you would find that to be real also, the reason is what they are all referring to, there is a reality which is so capacious you can approach in all of these ways, so these names and forms are a joint product of the limitless capaciousness of God, each one of Bhagawan, the Saguna Brahman and our human approach to it, there is a human approach because you'll see each culture, each religion has its own framework to approach it, just as different paths are different, these different names and forms concepts are also different, but they all work, they all work,
