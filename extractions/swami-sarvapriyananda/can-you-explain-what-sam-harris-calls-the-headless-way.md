## Transcript

Hello, Swamiji. It's an honor to be here again. What's your name? My name is Matt. A question actually you alluded to him before. You were talking about Sam Harris. Yes. Someone else you had here, great good. Yes. They both speak very highly of the headless way. I'm not sure if you're familiar with it. Yes. So I was wondering about what exactly myself and a lot of people seem to be missing with that, because when I can see that when I look back at the space here, it's empty and full of all the forms, and that there's no end even when I stick my head out, there's still consciousness here.

But to me it feels, and to many other people, it seems incredibly neutral, where it seems like anything no matter how painful is effortlessly welcomed into the present moment. Yes. But this description of infinite love and bliss, like what is missing here that of me and a lot of other people seem to be.

All right. So for to give context to the headless way, it's like this. So one person he wanted to see Shiva. And there's a story. And he meditated and did a lot of tapasya, spiritual practices. And he never saw Shiva. So in his dream, he was very sad. In his dream Shiva appeared to him. And this person said, I've been seeking you my Lord, but I've never been able to see you.

Then Shiva said, All right. Tomorrow I will come to you. Look for the headless person. And so the next morning this man very happily went around looking for the headless, I'll see Shiva today. But everybody has a head. See? They all have heads. Yeah. You also everybody has heads. Everybody has heads. Where is the headless person?

And until suddenly his own attention fell upon his own body. And he looked chest, neck. Can't see a head anywhere. Oh my God. This is what Shiva meant. The headless, who's the headless person? You are. So it's a Vedantic, the Mahavak, you know, Shiva is you. Tattva-masi, that you are. Or as Shankaracharya Singh's, Chidana-nanda-rupa, Shivoham, Shivoham, I am Shiva, I am Shiva.

Now what does it mean? This is the practice. The practice is, sit quietly, and notice that as it feels, as it feels means there's a word called phenomenology. Phenomenologically, I seem to have no head. Of course I have, but I seem to have no head. Because in the way I see it. And this space is full of what?

Everything, the whole universe is here. Only my head is not here. Now what does it mean? Stay with that. Stay with that experience. Instead of thinking of yourself, myself as a person somewhere in this skull, experiencing an external world, see that this remove this skull, this personality, it's a good, powerful meditation exercise.

And headless, I am there. The whole universe is appearing, where, where used to be that head. In this world, everything else. It will inevitably go to the witness consciousness, which is not an object. All our objects are appearing in me, the witness consciousness. Don't make the witness consciousness another object will become another skull, a head.

It is the headless one. In that witness consciousness, all of these forms are arising. And as he said, he said, I resist nothing. You can't. Everything that comes into consciousness is arising in that witness consciousness. Good, bad, desirable, undesirable, everything. Not the least bit of resistance is there.

Now notice two things about it. One. All the desirable, undesirable, good and bad, they arise and disappear in me in this headless space of awareness. They arise and disappear. In Vedanta, the ground in which an appearance arises and disappears. That ground is called the reality and the appearances are technical term is Mithya.

If you experience something, and then in the same place you experience its absence, then what you experience is not a reality. Then what is the reality? That ground is the reality. The underlying reality is that ground. Where did you experience it? In the headless space. Where are you experiencing everything?

In the headless space. So the whole universe, which appears and disappears, in the headless space, I am that headless space. In me, the whole universe appears and disappears. Therefore, the universe, all its people, all its events, good and bad are appearances, like a dream. Bad is also known as a dream.

You may call it a nightmare, it is also a dream. Because they are appearances, they are Mithya, they are faults, they are dream-like. The dream-like, the faults, the appearance, cannot affect the reality. Therefore you, the headless space, that one consciousness is not limited by a skull. You are not affected by what appears to you.

Therefore you can be neutral. For the painful and the not painful, because ultimately even the painful is not painful to you, that headless space. See the vast blue sky is neutral to bad weather and good weather. One reason being, the sky is very clever, because the so-called bad weather can't do anything to the sky.

The storms and thunder, thunder and lightning, they cannot affect the vast blue sky. Similarly, the headless space is not affected by whatever appears in the headless space. If it was a skull, it would be affected. I mean, what I mean is a person, a limited person. The unlimited space of awareness is not affected by whatever appears in the space of awareness.

And notice another thing, the reality never resists the appearance. Reality is no problem with appearance. On a movie screen, you can play any movie whatsoever. Any movie, tragedy, comedy, horror, realistic science fiction fantasy, whatever movie you want to play, you can play. The movie screen will not resist the movie, will not object to the movie.

Not only that, it will enable the movie. The movie is possible only because of the screen. Only because of you are that headless space, the entire universe, you have given its space, you have given it refuge. It can exist and appear in play around only because of you. But all of this is nice to hear. But one must trace it out in one's experience.

And that's why the headless way is a good way of starting because it starts with a, it's a little trick. Don't tell yourself what nonsense. I of course I have a head. Don't tell yourself that. Just go with the feeling of it. That here are people with heads. I can't see my own head. So headless. There's nothing here.

It's phenomenological. It's a trick. It's a trick of a way of throwing you back to your life. It's throwing you back to your nature as awareness. It's tricking whom? It's tricking the mind. Sticking the mind. Otherwise, if I think I am the person in this head, then the mind will think I'm this person. Yes, I am this person.

Who else am I? Vigyanavairava. There's a book in Kashmirishivism. There are 112 such tricks. This is one. There are 112 such tricks. I don't know if the headless space is there, but similar ones are there. Similar ones are there. All of them have this one purpose of tricking you into seeing the ever present pure consciousness.
