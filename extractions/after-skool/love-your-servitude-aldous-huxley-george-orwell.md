## Transcript

Today, we are faced, I think, with the approach of what may be called the ultimate revolution, a final revolution where a man can act directly on the mind body of his fellows. Well, needless to say, some kind of direct action on human mind bodies has been going on since the beginning of time, but this has generally been of a violent nature.

The techniques of terrorism have been known from time immemorial and people have employed with more or less ingenuity, sometimes with the utmost cruity, sometimes with a good deal of skill acquired by a process of trial and error of finding out what the best ways of using torture, imprisonment, constraints of various kinds.

But as, I think it was a metanych said many years ago, you can do everything with Bern, it's except sit on them, that if you are going to control any population for any length of time, you must have some measure of consent, it's exceedingly difficult to see how pure terrorism can function indefinitely, it can function for a fairly long time.

But I think sooner or later you have to bring in an element of persuasion, an element of getting people to consent to what is happening to them. Well, it seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this that we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy, who have always existed and presumably always will exist, to get people actually to love their servitude.

This seems to me the ultimate in malevolent revolution, shall we say, and that there seems to be a general movement in the direction of this kind of ultimate revolution, this method of control by which people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to enjoy.

This is the enjoyment of servitude. And first let me talk a little bit about the improvement even in the techniques of terrorism. I think that there have been improvements. Pavlov, after all, made some extremely profound observations both on animals and on human beings. And he found, among other things, that conditioning techniques applied to animals or humans in a state either of psychological or physical stress, sank in, so to say, very deeply into the mind-body of the creature, and were extremely difficult to get rid of that they seem to be embedded more deeply than other forms of conditioning.

In this context I would like to mention the extremely interesting chapters in Dr. William Sargent's battle for the mind, where he points out how intuitively some of the great religious teachers, leaders of the past, hit on the Pavlovian method. He speaks specifically of Wesley's method of producing conversions which were essentially based upon a technique of heightening psychological stress to the limit by talking about hellfire, and so making people extremely vulnerable to suggestion, and then suddenly releasing this stress by offering the hopes of heaven.

And this is a very interesting chapter of showing how how completely, on purely intuitive and empirical grounds, a skill natural psychologist, as Wesley was, could discover these Pavlovian methods. Well, as I say, we now know the reason why these techniques worked, and there is no doubt at all that we can if we want to carry them much further than was possible in the past.

And of course, in the history of recent history of brainwashing, both has applied to prisoners of war and to the lower personnel within the Communist Party in China, we see that the Pavlovian methods have been applied systematically and with evidently, with extraordinary efficacy. I mean, I think there can be no doubt that by the application of these methods, a very large army of totally devoted people has been created, the conditioning has been driven in, so to say, by kind of psychological, Ionter-Faresis into the very depth of the people's being and has got so deep that it's very difficult for it ever to be rooted out.

And these methods, I think, are a real refinement on the older methods of terror, because they combine methods of terror with methods of acceptance, that the person who he is subjected to a form of terroristic stress, but for the purpose of inducing a kind of voluntary quotes, acceptance of the psychological state into which he has been driven and the state of affairs within which he finds himself.

So that as I say, there has been, I think, a definite improvement, shall we say, even in the techniques of terrorism. Well, then we come to the consideration of other techniques of non-terroristic techniques for inducing consent and for inducing people who love their servitude. First of all, there are the methods connected with straight suggestion and hypnosis.

I think we know much more about this subject than was known in the past. People, of course, have always known about suggestion and although they didn't know the word hypnosis, they certainly practiced it. But we now, I think, know pretty clearly that there's sort of statistical structure of a population in regard to its suggestibility.

It's very interesting, when you look at the findings in different fields, I mean in the field of hypnosis in the field of administering placebo, for example, in the field of general suggestion in states of drowsiness or of light sleep, you will find the same sorts of orders of magnitude continually cropping up.

You will find, for example, that the experienced hypnotists will tell one that the number of people, the percentage of people who can be hypnotized with the utmost facility, just like that, is about 20%, that about a corresponding number at the other end of the scale are very, very difficult or almost impossible to hypnotize, and that in between there lies a large mass of people who can, with more or less difficulty, be hypnotized, that they can gradually be, if you work hard enough at it, be, be got into the hypnotic state.

And in the same way, when the same sort of figures crop up again, for example, in relation to the administration of placebo, so a big experiment was carried out three or four years ago in the general hospital in Boston, on postoperative cases where several hundred men and women suffering comparable kinds of pain after serious operations were given injections whenever they asked for them, whenever the pain got bad, and the injections at 50% of the time were of morphia and 50% of the time were of distilled water, and about 20% of those who went through the experiment, about 20% of them got just as much relief from the distilled waters from the morphia, about 20% got no relief from the distilled water, and in between with those who got some relief or got relief occasionally, so here again we see the same sort of distribution, and I suspect also that it would not be at all difficult to recognize in very early childhood who were those who were extremely suggestible, who were those who were extremely unsuggestible, and who were those who occupied the intermediate space, quite clearly if everybody were extremely unsuggestible, organized society would be quite impossible, and if everybody were extremely suggestible, then dictatorship would be absolutely inevitable, I mean it's very fortunate we have people who are moderately suggestible in the majority and who therefore preserve us from dictatorship, but to permit organized society to be formed, but once given the fact that there are these 20% to finally suggestible people, it becomes quite clear that this is a matter of enormous political importance, for example any endemicog who is able to get hold of a large number of these 20% of suggestible people and to organize them is really in a position to overthrow any government in any country, and I mean I think this after all we've had the most incredible example in recent years of what can be done by efficient methods of suggestion and persuasion in the form of Hitler, anybody who's a raid for example Bullock's life of Hitler comes forth from this with a sort of horrified admiration for this infernal genius who really understood human weaknesses I think almost better than anybody and who exploited them with all the resources then available, I mean he knew everything, I mean for example he knew intuitively this Pavlovian truth that conditioning installed in a state of stress or fatigue goes much deeper than conditioning installed at other times, this was why all his big speeches were organized at night, he speaks to this quite frankly of course in my encompasses, this was done solely because people had tired at night and therefore a much less capable of resisting persuasion than they would be doing the day, and we see in all his techniques he was using he had discovered intuitively and by trial and error, great many of the weaknesses which we now know about on a sort of scientific way I think much more clearly than he does, than he did but the fact remains that this differential suggestibility, this susceptibility to hypnosis, I do think has is something which has to be considered very carefully in relation to any kind of thought about democratic government, I mean if there are 20 percent of the people who can really be suggested into believing almost anything as evidently they can be, then we have to take extremely careful steps to prevent the rise of demagogues who will drive them on into extreme positions and then organize them into very very dangerous armies, private armies which may overthrow the government, this as I say is in this field of pure persuasion, I think we do know much more than we did in the past and obviously we now have mechanisms for multiplying the demagogues, voice and image in a quite hallucinatory way, I mean the television and the radio, Hitler was making enormous use of the radio, he could speak to millions of people simultaneously, I mean this alone of course is creates an enormous gulf between the modern and the ancient demagogum, the ancient demagogu could only appeal to as many people as his voice could reach by the yelling at his utmost but the modern demagogu can touch literally millions at a time and of course with this the multiplication of his image he can produce this kind of hallucinatory effect which is of enormous hypnotic and suggestive importance.

In these techniques which were the object of application is the human being, you're obviously up against the most dangerous situation and what will be the temptation for those in power, I mean after all we pray regularly not to be led into temptation and this is a very profound and important prayer, I mean experience sadly shows that if we are tempted long enough and strongly enough we almost invariably succumb and that the whole process of setting up a decent society is essentially setting up the society in which temptations to abuse power and shall be reduced to a minimum but these new techniques I think do constitute a series of very powerful temptations which to those in authority may be finally turned out to be irresistible, I hope not but I think what you say is something which we have to think about, I mean that this might be applied with justification as you say in the highest patriotic and moral terms even in democratic societies I trust not but but one never knows.

In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph and self-abacement, the sex instinct will be eradicated, we shall abolish the orgasm, there will be no loyalty except loyalty to the party but always there will be the intoxication of power, always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on enemy who is helpless, if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever.

The moral to be drawn from this dangerous nightmare situation is a simple one don't let it happen, it depends on you.
