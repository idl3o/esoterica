## Transcript

What civilization is is 6 billion people trying to make themselves happy by standing on each other's shoulders and kicking each other's teeth in. It's not a pleasant situation. And yet, you can stand back and look at this planet and see that we have the money, the power, the medical understanding, the scientific know how the love and the community to produce the kind of human paradise.

But we are led by the least of months, the least intelligent, the least noble, the least visionary, we are led by the least of months. And we do not fight back against the dehumanizing values that are handed down as control icons. This is something I don't really want to give off on this tear because it's the lecturing itself.

But culture is not your friend. Culture is for other people's convenience and the convenience of various institutions, churches, companies, tax conventions, themes, what have you. It is not your friend. It insults you. It deceit powers you. It uses and uses you. None of us are well treated by culture. And yet we glorify the creative potential of the individual, the rights of the individual.

We understand the felt presence of experiences, what is most important. But the culture is a perversion. It fetishizes objects. It creates consumer makeup. It preaches endless forms of false happiness. Endless forms of false understanding in the form of swirly religions and silly cults. It invites people to diminish themselves and dehumanize themselves by behaving like machines.

The Univariate Consist of Nuns simultaneously apprehended events. Nuns involving hallucinogens that give you a sense of unity with your fellow. You can't see it being just never known. I feel sorry for you.
