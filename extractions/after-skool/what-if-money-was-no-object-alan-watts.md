## Transcript

What do you desire? What makes you itch? What sort of a situation would you like? Let's suppose that I do this often in vocational guidance of students. They come to me and say, well, we're getting out of college and we have the faintest idea of what we want to do. So I always ask the question, what would you like to do if money were no object?

What would you really enjoy spending your life? Well, it's so amazing as a result of our kind of educational system, crowds of students say, well, we'd like to be painters, we'd like to be poets, we'd like to be writers, but as everybody knows, you can't earn any money that way. One other person says, well, I'd like to live an out of doors life and write horses.

I say, do you want to teach in a writing school? Let's go through with it. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something, which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him, you do that and forget the money because if you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time.

You'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living. That is to go on doing things you don't like doing, which is stupid. Better to have a short life. That is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you're doing, it doesn't matter what it is.

You can eventually turn it, you could eventually become a master of it. It's the only way to become a master of something, to be really with it. And then you'll be able to get a good fee for whatever it is. So don't worry too much, everybody is interested in everything. And anything you could be interested in, you'll find others.

But it's absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don't like in order to go on spending things you don't like doing things you don't like. And to teach your children to follow in the same track. See what we're doing is we're bringing up children and educated to live the same sort of lives we are living in.

In order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children, to bring up their children, to do the same thing. So it's all wretched, no vomit. It never gets there. And so therefore it's so important to consider this question, what do I desire?
