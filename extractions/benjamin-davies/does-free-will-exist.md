## Transcript

what is your position on free will? So first of all in para-philosophy there must be a perfect correspondence between the subjectivistic perspective of being a conscious subject and the objectivistic perspective of there being a world evolving purely in accordance with natural laws and on the side of the subject we have an idealistic theory in which free will is necessary and on the side of the object we have a materialistic theory in which everything's determined by prior states.

Now these two ways to approach metaphysics must be perfectly corresponding to each other in para-philosophy and this is again due to the necessity of a kind of double aspect monism between the ideal and the material and so the nature of free will is an interesting and difficult question but I'm fairly certain at this point that the answer lies in a proper interpretation of quantum mechanics wherein the apparent randomness of quantum mechanical processes and wave function collapse must conceal some kind of hidden variable and these hidden variables must provide a correlation between free choice and pure determinism.

Now normally that would be a contradiction but in a double aspect theory there can be a correlation without that being a causation. So what this entails is that conscious thought involves some kind of quantum mechanical process as does the neurological processing of the purely physical aspect of thought and therefore the cause of thought subjective thought cannot be statistically independent from the purely mechanical results of neurological firings in the brain and therefore quantum mechanical events in the brain neurologically are caused by hidden variables but also the purely subjective experience of choosing one thought over another is caused by those same hidden variables and therefore you can see that this is not a physicalist ontology the hidden variables are neutral to both but they have two aspects and that the fact that their neutral doesn't break the deterministic causal change because everything ultimately is an aspect or an expression of some neutral substance.

So now to really answer the question we need to solve quantum mechanics I think as far as I know the the current models and I should say first that hidden variables are not allowed in standard interpretations of quantum mechanics because they violate bells inequality but there are a couple of ways to escape bells inequality and the two that jump to my mind right now are David Boehm's pilot wave theory which posits the existence of a particle and a guiding wave and the other possibility which is something that I suspected when I was first getting into developing power philosophy that is something called super determinism and now super determinism has got way more popular since whatever it was I first came onto the idea which would have been in 2014 but it's portrayed in a very different way than how I interpreted it back then if you know anything about super determinism people often talk about how super determinism disproves free will because everything's fundamentally determined by physical causes and by physical hidden variables however obviously this view is operating in a purely physicalistic ontology without the kind of dualism that power philosophy necessitates and the correspondence between this what is I accept a purely deterministic process is merely that that deterministic process is correlated with something that is that allows for free will if super determinism has any validity within power philosophy it would not undermine science as is typically claimed that super determinism would in so far again as our choices to set up an experiment in one way would not be independent from the results of those experiments in fact in power philosophy super determinism would be the mechanism by which the reality does appear to operate in accordance with natural rules and it would be the reason why reality is rationally interpretable it would be a necessary feature of reality because reality is expressing it self in a way that is rational and logical and which can be studied through science so yes reality is putting on a show to us but it's not doing that to fool us it's doing us that to allow us to gain a reproducible understanding of what's going on in the experience and to evolve to ever higher levels of intelligence and I think the last thing I would say is that there's this idea of not yet gotten around to reading lighten its but it has this idea of a pre-established harmony and I think that kind of could be related to the basic process that's going on in a super deterministic universe and again this is going to be related to psychophysical parallelism to Jung's idea of synchronicity and to the idea that you can explain reality purely in terms of science but that is just the outside Europe explaining and it will always miss half of the image but that other half of the image is correlated with everything that's going on outside so no free will cannot exist everything's determined by natural laws and yes free will exists but your choices don't change anything physical it's merely that the physical changes your choices would have made if there was free will do happen by luck it's merely that there's a correlation between the seemingly random outcomes of events and the physical effects that would have happened if your choices did affect physical things that makes any sense listen to our few times I'm sure it will make sense at some point I'll try out one more time now if we consider that there's some sort of random process going on in the brain a quantum mechanical process which allows for the possibility which which allows for multiple possible results if we consider the outcome of those results is purely random these results could be raising my left hand or raising my right hand there's a 50% chance the outcome is purely random but I choose to raise my left hand I have the thought to to raise my left hand but there's a 50-50 chance physically now there will be a correlation between the outcome of a random event a genuinely random event and my choices it's merely that the outcome of the random event luckily correlates with my thought and that happens all the time in it all thought every thought is correlated with what is otherwise a seemingly random event however there are hidden variables so it isn't genuinely a random event but it for all intents and purposes it is a random event there's some kind of higher causality that is determining both our thought and the outcomes of random events so we don't have free will but it's just as if we do and there really is no difference between those two ideas I mean they really try to stay away from religious ideas but it's do you imagine that there was a guard for example and it would be like saying he's the one choosing we all think we are choosing but he's choosing what we're choosing so we don't have free will although free will is happening through us and if we did have free will this God would choose the exact same thing as we would have chosen so there's literally no difference but I want to be clear that I'm just using that as an analogy there's no necessity for God in this although there could be some kind of higher causation which can be explicated in rationalistic and secular terms if you have any other questions about para-philosophy or want my opinion on some other philosophical idea please let me know in the comments below if you disagree with anything I've said I invite your challenge I'm always looking to expand my understanding if you want to join a community of curious intelligent and like-minded souls you are welcomed into the para-philosophy discord if you want to learn about para-philosophy I humbly ask you to consider buying my book or gain
