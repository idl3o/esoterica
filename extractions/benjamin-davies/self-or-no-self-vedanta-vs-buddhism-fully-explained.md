## Transcript

Hello and welcome back to returning viewers. Thank you for joining to the new ones. This is going to be the first of several videos in which we explore the relations between three prominent Indian philosophies. Those being Madhyamika Buddhism, Yogacara Buddhism, and Advaita Vedanta. This is itself part of a longer series on the topic of the ultimate truth, and the relation between the absolute and the relative.

If you’re new to my videos, my name is Ben and I’m working on something called “paraphilosophy”, which among other things is a kind of meta-framework through which we can interpret different traditions. I get a lot of comments on my videos saying things like “This sounds a lot like x, y, z tradition or philosopher”, and Nagarjuna and Shankara are two names that crop up quite often.

It’s from these thinkers of course that we get the traditions of Madhyamika and Advaita Vedanta respectively. In this video, we’ll be exploring the similarities and differences between these Indian traditions, as well as the Yogacara school of Buddhism and the wider tradition of Vedanta. I’ll be referring a little bit to ideas we developed in the previous video, so you may wish to watch that in addition to this, but for the most part this video can stand on its own.

If you find this content valuable and would like to enable me to continue with this work, please consider supporting me through Patreon or YouTube. Any support would be tremendously helpful. Thank you, and enjoy the video. So, to jump right into it, as many of you will know, the obvious difference between Vedanta generally and Buddhism generally, is that Vedanta posits a theory of self, where "self" refers to an eternal enduring substance, while Buddhism advocates a theory of no-self, emphasizing the absence of any permanent, unchanging stuff.

So, Vedanta subscribes to a metaphysics of substance, whereas Buddhism aligns more closely with a metaphysics of process, viewing reality as a series of interconnected yet impermanent events. The situation is really more nuanced than this though, because, while the Buddha did certainly deny the kind of substantial self that Vedanta often claims, he also discouraged turning the denial of self into a dogmatic metaphysical view.

Instead, he taught that any definitive idea we can have about the self's existence or non-existence is unhelpful. The Buddha rejected both eternalistic idealism, which posits an eternal, unchanging self, and annihilistic materialism, which claims that there is no continuous sense of self at all. Instead, he emphasized a Middle Way, focusing on the impermanent and interdependent nature of all phenomena, including what we conventionally perceive as the self.

It is for this reason that the early Buddhist teaching on no-self is principally focused on eliminating our ordinary egoic identifications of self, and of course Vedanta also denies that such identifications constitute one’s genuine self. But when questioned on metaphysical matters of ultimate reality, the Buddha famously maintained silence.

Such questions were deemed to be unanswerable or inexpressible, not because the Buddha did not know the answers, but because the true nature of things cannot be grasped by conceptual thinking, and to answer with concepts would have mislead many of his followers. The point of the Buddhas teaching is that anything at all which we might cling to, or identify with, is not a self—it is not an eternal enduring substance or reality.

Indeed, it is precisely the mental grasping at concepts which obscures the true nature of things, and so I must provide a warning right now, that the very premise of our discussion in these videos, which is the comparison of concepts like self and no-self, substance and process, Atman and Emptiness, is the opposite of what those concepts are designed to point towards.

Even if we can solve all the intellectual dilemmas distinguishing different traditions of Indian philosophy, nothing shall be truly solved until we let go of all conceptions of being “this way” or “that way”. In both traditions, whatever reality there may be, it transcends our conceptual grasp. Now, I should say at this point that I, just as many of you, recognize an obvious connection between paraphilosophy and the Madhyamika philosophy of Nagarjuna, who took the method of the negation of concepts to its logical conclusion in the Buddhist tradition, just as we aim to show the relativity of concepts in paraphilosophy.

That is, the Madhyamaka formalization of this methodology of dismantling views on ultimate reality is similar to the methodology of paraphilosophy. The four alternatives, or catuskoti, represent the four categories of thought, in a similar manner to the dialectical matrix. So, we can already begin to see a bit of a problem here for certain classical Vedic positions, which proclaim the existence of an ultimate substance called Brahman.

If Brahman is an immutable, universal, and substantial entity, then we can ascribe such concepts to Brahman, which makes the belief in this Brahman a philosophical perspective. However, in the Advaita Vedanta philosophy, Brahman refers to an indescribable, nondual suchness, beyond all mental concepts.

And this would imply that Brahman is also beyond any philosophical perspective as to what itself is. And while some of the Upanishads do describe the Ultimate Reality in positive terms, others employ the method of negation—“neti neti”, or “not this, not that”—to show that all of the possible objects of consciousness are not the Self.

The difference between the Vedantic method of negation and the Madhyamika method of negation, is that Vedanta sees that once we remove all the content of consciousness, what we are left with is pure awareness, which is unchanging and absolute. Madhyamaka, on the other hand, refuses to reify this awareness, because any awareness we identify is always the awareness of something—meaning it never appears independently, but only in relation to the very concepts we are negating.

However, this does not mean that it outright denies the existence of an absolute principle, because Madhyamaka does not equate the fact that nothing is left after we negate everything we can point to with the idea that ultimately there is just absolute nothingness. This would be a nihilistic perspective, and even if there is nothing left to grasp, we cannot deny that there is such a thing as the awareness of phenomena, and so something does appear, and there is ultimately the potential for this something to appear.

That which can be negated through the catuskoti is always conceptual, and so we can only interpret the fact that everything can be negated as the fact that every concept of how things are, which could cling to, can be negated, and thrown away. Accordingly, if the Vedanta position frames nondual awareness as something we can grasp, which it seems to do when it describes it as an immutable substratum underlying all appearances, then we have not negated all conceptual content.

So, it seems reasonable that affirming awareness as an ultimate reality is going too far, but negating awareness as if it were totally unreal is also going too far. What remains after the process of negation can only be referred to as “the ungraspable”—that which is beyond concepts and perspectives; the parajective; and paraphilosophy.

Both Madhyamaka and Advaita Vedanta are undoubtedly pointing at the paraphilosophical, but they do this in completely opposite ways. And I’m not saying by this that this means they must be compatible, we must also recognize that there is an apparent contradiction between them. I am merely saying that the thing they are pointing at is, in a manner of speaking, the same ultimate reality, characterised in two ways: one is logical and negative; the other is experiential and positive.

The ultimate truths of Madhyamaka and Advaita Vedanta are also, therefore, opposites. Sunyata, or emptiness, is the absence of any permanent stuff, and is associated with the idea that all phenomena arise only in dependence with other phenomena; while Brahman is the presence of a permanent essence underlying the multiplicity of phenomena.

I think a helpful way to characterize the difference between the Madhyamaka notion of Sunyata, or Emptiness, which is beyond all mental categories, and the Advaitan notion of Brahman, which is beyond all mental categories, is to say that Emptiness refers to the absence of an ultimate cause, while Brahman refers to the presence of an uncaused ultimate.

So, while both traditions utilize the method of negation, Vedanta generally does so with the aim of revealing that which does exist positively. For this reason, the wider tradition of Hindu philosophy typically describes Brahman as an ultimate substance, which aligns with the notion of concrete universality, making this interpretation a form of superjectivism, and indeed, many of the schools of Hinduism talk of Brahman as a dynamic, self-aware absolute that contains all differentiation within itself–Ishvara–and this is somewhat similar to Hegel’s Absolute Idealism, although the in the latter, the ultimate principle is impersonal.

Advaita Vedanta, however, could be thought of as also having strong elements of Kant’s transcendental idealism, insofar as there is an objective noumenal reality that exists beyond our cognitive apparatus. The difference being that Advaita does not hold the noumenon to be entirely unknowable—just ineffable.

Indeed, Brahman, which is pure awareness, is beyond the phenomenal, which is deemed an illusion. It's also worth noting Kant’s assertion that we can say nothing of the noumenon in some ways mirrors the Buddha’s silence in response to metaphysical questions. So, the Brahman of Vedanta largely falls into the category of superjectivism, where subjectivity and objectivity have been united.

However, the Advaita tradition stretches this association to its limit, because it posits two aspects of Brahman. There is a conceptual aspect of Brahman, which is concrete universality, but there is also a nonconceptual aspect which entirely transcends the categories of understanding, and thus transcends our dialectical matrix of conceptual thought.

If we take “paraphilosophy” as designating the notion of being “beyond conceptual thought”, then Advaita Vedanta could be considered as a form of paraphilosophy, along with Madhyamika. I want to be clear however that the alternative Hindu claim that Brahman is an independently existing ultimate substance, and particularly the notion of Brahman as Ishvara or “Supreme Self”, is a philosophical perspective that can be characterized by the dialectical matrix, as a form of superjectivism, and so it is less clear to what extent this interpretation alone is compatible with paraphilosophy.

If it implies that the superjective is the absolute truth while the other perspectives and quadrants are invalid, then it would seem to be much less compatible. The difficulty with Vedanta generally—and I think this is also the issue with trying to reconcile Vedanta and Buddhism—is that there is a natural tendency to want to make a concept out of the nonconceptual, a philosophy out of paraphilosophy, and a belief system out of that which is beyond belief; where Brahman becomes an ultimate object of worship.

And it’s understandable why it wants to do this. It doesn’t want to inadvertently imply the nonexistence of ultimate reality by merely negating and not asserting, and it recognizes the soteriological danger of negating the phenomenal world without acknowledging the existence of something more fundamental, even if this thing cannot be asserted as a sort of ultimate substance.

Madhyamaka, by comparison, is quite content to negate the ultimate existence of the phenomenal world without asserting anything else, because it recognizes that even if there is something more, to accept that as true would be to make a concept out of the nonconceptual, which it simply is not willing to do, or risk doing.

The true nature of things can be recognized through nondual experience alone, and any intellectual argumentation occurs within a framework of duality. Madhyamika is chiefly concerned with articulating how all things depend on all things, such that there is nothing anywhere which is substantial, inherently existent, or independent.

Thus, while the Brahman of Vedanta is the presence of an ultimate thing, the Emptiness of Buddhism is its absence. Yet, what both are pointing towards is neither present nor absent nor both nor neither, because these are just concepts, and the only ultimately true teaching that has ever been given is silence.

So, I hope that helps to explain the basic difference between Madhyamika and Vedanta. Whether this disagreement is fundamental or superficial is something we’ll return to later. First, we need to recognize that Madhyamika is not the only school of Buddhism, and it’s not the only school in Mahayana. The other major tradition of Mahayana is Yogacara.

Now, another name for Madhyamika is Sunyavada, meaning “the doctrine of emptiness”, while another name for Yogacara is Vijnanavada, which means “the doctrine of consciousness”. In order for us to understand the relation between the Yogacara and the Vedantic focus on consciousness, then, we’re first going spend a moment to highlight the main differences between Madhyamika and Yogacara Buddhism.

Now, again, in a similar manner to paraphilosophy, Nagarjuna’s Madhyamika philosophy gets to work by deconstructing dualistic modes of thinking and one-sided perspectives, and it does this to emphasize the notion of Emptiness, being the absence of inherent existence in all things, including itself. Yogacara’s unique contribution, on the other hand, is a sort of phenomenological analysis of consciousness.

It agrees with the Madhyamaka that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, but its main concern is to emphasize the illusory nature of our perception of the distinction of subjects and objects. It therefore teaches that the truth is the world without any notion of subject-object duality, and without this duality, what remains is the interdependently originated, and therefore empty, appearances of consciousness.

Yogacara is therefore sometimes called the “consciousness-only” school, which makes it sound as though it is ascribing some sort of fundamental nature or inherent existence to consciousness, but this is not really the case. Yogacara is nondualistic in the sense that consciousness and appearances are not two different things; and so, insofar as appearances are impermanent and interdependent, the forms of consciousness—which are actually just the appearances—are also impermanent and interdependent.

In other words, consciousness is a dynamic process, and not an immutable substance. So, the difference, as I see it, is this. Madhyamika denies an independent ultimate reality—that which grounds appearances—leaving only the dependently originated appearances behind; but Yogacara denies the objectivity of conventional reality—the appearances within consciousness—arguing that what we take as the external world is a manifestation of consciousness.

That is, what Yogacara is emphasizing is that the absence of inherent existence in phenomena is something that actually exists—it is consciousness that is empty of anything permanent. Emptiness exists in the sense that that which is empty exists, and that which is empty is consciousness. However, Yogacara does not assert that consciousness is an immutable substance or an inherently existing thing, because if consciousness was a substance then its appearances would likewise have inherent existence, which they do not.

Consciousness is precisely the dependent arising of phenomena, and the groundlessness of phenomena is simply the fact that they are dependently originated as consciousness appearing to itself. Another way to look at this would be to say consciousness is the existence of no-self, or of process, rather than the non-existence of self or substance—it is the presence of an absence (i.

e. there is no-self) rather than the absence of a presence (i. e. there is not self). Consciousness is not independent of phenomena, because phenomena are the interdependent, and therefore empty, appearances of consciousness. So, Yogacara emphasizes that the negation of duality and relativity can be characterized in a more positive way, complementing the more radically negative characterization of emptiness in Madhyamika, which is more emphatically non-implicative.

And this makes sense because there /is indeed such a thing as phenomenal experience, and so, Emptiness is not absolute negation but is apparent as the changing process of conscious experience. In this way, Yogacara seems to have something in common with Vedanta, in its intention to focus on the positive aspect of the method of negation.

However, it is also important to keep in mind that both Yogacara and Madhyamika are aligned on the fact that neither consciousness nor phenomena have inherent existence or self-nature, because consciousness is not an independent ultimate thing, but rather the basic nature of the ever-changing web of phenomena.

Alright, we’ll come back to the debate between Yogacara and Madhyamika in a little bit, next we’re going to consider the relation between Yogacara and Vedanta. I think a helpful way to characterize the relation between the foundational consciousnesses found in Vedanta and Yogacara respectively, would be to say that the ground of experience in Vedanta is Pure Conscious Being, while the ground of experience in Yogacara is Pure Conscious Doing.

Vedanta does also recognize that there is an active aspect to Brahman, because otherwise there could not be experience, but the most fundamental level of their ontology is entirely immutable, while the most fundamental level of the Yogacara ontology is dynamic. Consciousness as a Being is a substratum on which dualistic phenomena are superimposed, while Consciousness as a Doing, or a process, is simply the underlying true nature of dualistic phenomena, which is to say that phenomena are the transformations of this active consciousness.

So, what Vedanta is basically saying is that consciousness–Brahman–is that which makes experience possible, and what Yogacara is saying is that consciousness–Vijnana–is that which makes the experienced possible, which are appearances. To put this even more simply, Vedanta says that the knowable makes knowing possible, while Yogacara says that knowing makes the knowable possible.

There’s an important difference. The former grounds everything in a fixed substance, being a theory of Self; the latter grounds everything in a changing process, being a theory of no-Self. “Knowing”, for Yogacara, is the conscious process of experience, and is what really exists, while “that which is known” are the mere appearances of this consciousness—there is nothing ultimately independent of the doing of knowing.

The Yogacara ground of reality is therefore a dynamic, intentional, consciousness, which exists only through its representations, and is therefore not an independent ultimate substratum like Brahman. Nevertheless, both traditions recognize two ways to talk of reality. There is our empirical, phenomenal world, and then there is the true nature of that world.

The difference is that Vedanta says that the true nature of the world transcends the empirical world, and the Advaita tradition says that phenomena are superimpositions onto Brahman due to ignorance. But Yogacara says that the true nature of the world and the empirical world are totally interfused—there is really just one domain of reality that can either be perceived accurately and wisely, as the transformations of consciousness, or falsely and ignorantly, as a duality of subjects and objects.

It is the false notion of objectivity which leads to subject-object duality, and this duality exists within nondual consciousness. So, while both Advaita Vedanta and Yogacara talk of the world as an illusion, they do so in slightly different ways. For Yogacara, the world is an appearance of consciousness, and so things do exist as appearances of consciousness; they just don’t exist as independent objects and subjects.

For Advaita Vedanta, the world is an illusion due to ignorance, and can ultimately be called neither real nor unreal as an illusion, because the illusion is just ignorance of reality. In this way, Advaita Vedanta is not making the claim that consciousness and phenomena are nondual in a relational or phenomenological sense, because this would imply a unifying relation between consciousness and phenomena that is not real and is not needed.

In other words, it’s not that consciousness and phenomena are really the same thing, but that there never were any phenomena to begin with. Any epistemic notion of nonduality is not helpful, because only Brahman is ultimately real, and so Advaita Vedanta is a form of absolute monism. Really, all forms of Vedana are absolute monisms, but not all of them are quite as radical in denying multiplicity as Advaita.

Conversely, Yogacara is nondualistic in a more phenomenological sense, because what it’s saying is precisely that there is no duality between phenomena and consciousness—there is just phenomenal consciousness. The term “nondual” is quite literal in Advaita Vedanta. It refers to the idea that the ultimate reality, Brahman, is not different from our individual awareness—atman.

The changing world of appearances appears to be different from Brahman due to ignorance, but since it has no independent existence, to say that it is either the same as or different from Brahman would imply that it is in some sense real. So, Brahman and Atman are both real, and are both the same thing, so they are nondual; but Brahman and the world are not both real, so they are not the same thing–there is only Brahman and nothing for it to relate to.

Let us now try to relate all of this to paraphilosophy. This is not entirely straightforward, because there are at least two ways to interpret the teachings of both Vedanta and Yogacara, but we’ll start with the more conventional interpretations. So, Yogacara says that there are two ways to think about reality: the experienced phenomena themselves, which are abjective abstract particulars; and a dynamic consciousness, which is the superjective concrete universal.

It then explains how the former is the simply the appearance of the latter, such that there is fundamentally no difference between them. Yogacara is therefore often interpreted as a form of epistemic idealism, wherein the world is not objectively real. Yogacara distinguishes between the form of consciousness, which in paraphilosophy would be a kind of neutral, abjective structure, and the apparent object that is superimposed onto that structure.

The interdependent form is relatively real, but the apparently independent object is entirely unreal. Advaita, on the other hand, treats both the superimposition and the form in consciousness–the appearance–as part of one and the same illusion. Brahman does not change, and so anything that changes, whether consciousness or objects, is an illusion.

In Yogacara, the most fundamental level of consciousness, which is called the alaya-vijnana, or the storehouse-consciousness, does change, and so there are similarities between this concept and the Vedantic notion of Brahman considered in its active Saguna role of Ishvara–the Supreme Self–which creates the world.

In Advaita, this too is an illusion, but it’s not in other forms of Vedanta. Because the dynamic nature of consciousness is fundamental in Yogacara, what we perceive as objective reality is really just manifestation of our own mental processes and has no independent existence. But because the dynamic nature of consciousness in Advaita is ultimately illusory, its apparent objectivity is not a projection of individual consciousness, but a cosmic superimposition.

It appears real at the empirical level from the standpoint of ignorance, but it lacks ultimate substance. Both objectivity and subjectivity are parts of the illusion superimposed onto Brahman. There are, however, debates about the extent to which storehouse-consciousness can be talked of as universal, as each individual has their own storehouse-consciousness which is changing moment to moment.

The alaya-vijnana is also impersonal and unconscious, while Hinduism typically depicts Ishvara as a kind of personal God. We’ll find later on in this series that there are also some similarities between the storehouse-consciousness and both Hegel’s concept of Spirit, and Schopenhauer’s concept of Will.

That is because the storehouse-consciousness contains the seeds of karma, which are sustained by the afflictions of knowledge of the ego, and attachment to the ego, which relate to the human drives of reason and emotion, and to what I have elsewhere termed righteousness and pleasure. But in summary, Yogacara in its most common form describes the world in a similar way to paraphilosophy.

There are appearances–abjective abstract particulars–and there is consciousness–superjective concrete universal–and while these are separable at the conventional level, the goal of spiritual practice is to realise their nonduality. Moving over to Vedanta, the early Upanishads describe phenomena as the playful emanation of Brahman; and in this view, Brahman has a dual aspect: a pure, unchanging aspect as the eternal witness, and a dynamic aspect manifesting as the changing appearances of the world.

This bears some resemblance to Yogacara, where phenomena are seen as the transforming appearances of consciousness. However, the key difference is that the Upanishads describe phenomena as dependent on, but not identical to, consciousness. Yogacara and Vedanta can be viewed as similar philosophies with opposite emphases, since both describe the interplay of the flux of appearances and consciousness.

If we interpret Yogacara as denying that consciousness is in any sense absolute or universal, then it is leaning a little more towards abjectivism, where reality is composed basically of appearances, albeit conscious appearances, making Yogacara a kind of idealistic pluralism. Vedanta on the other hand accepts absolute consciousness while denying that phenomena are ultimately real, and therefore leans a little more towards superjectivism and absolute idealism.

However, there is a more ultimate interpretation of both these traditions, which complicates things. In later Upanishads, such as the Mandukya Upanishad, the concept of the world as maya, or illusion, becomes more prominent compared to the earlier notion of lila, or divine play. This view was of course further developed in Adi Shankara’s Advaita philosophy, which asserts that Brahman is beyond perspectives and attributes altogether, which means it would be improper to isolate Brahman to the superjectivist perspective.

Brahman must be beyond the dialectical matrix, and be related to the parajective, with the changing aspect of Brahman, along with all the other perspectives, being maya–an illusory superimposition on the unchanging reality of Brahman. And on the Yogacara side, the buck does not stop with the alaya-vijnana, because even the storehouse consciousness is a conditioned phenomenon that is transcended upon awakening.

The storehouse consciousness is the dynamic substratum of illusion, and is therefore the fundamental element only of illusion, and of the false sense of self. It is dependent and empty. Jnana is the Sanskrit word for nondual wisdom, and in Buddhism, this is what is revealed when the alaya-vijnana is purified.

It is not a dualistic consciousness, but a pure awareness beyond concepts. It is referred to as Tathata or Suchness and is the pure immediacy of experience which cannot be spoken of at all. To speak of it is to conceptualize it, and Suchness is empty of concepts. Suchness in Yogacara is therefore connected to Emptiness in Madhyamaka, the major difference being that while Emptiness is framed as the purely negative absence of an ultimate essence, Suchness is framed as the positive, luminous quality of awareness.

However, both are ultimately beyond conceptualization, and so both the negative emphasis and the positive emphasis are only valid conventionally. Ultimately, neither of these capture the true nature of reality. Suchness is what remains when the illusion is gone—not as a hidden reality, but as the true nature of appearance, without the superimposition of concepts.

It is therefore not something separate from appearances, so it’s not taken as an independent absolute principle like Brahman, but it is also not dependent on them, since they are not ultimately real. So, Yogacara isn’t quite going as far in the negative direction as Madhyamaka in emphasizing emptiness as merely a non-implicative negation of phenomena and refusing to say that there is anything at all that remains once conceptual elaborations are removed; nor is it going as far in the positive direction as Vedanta in claiming Suchness as an independent absolute thing.

Yogacara wants to avoid saying that Suchness is dependent on phenomena while also avoiding saying that it is anything apart from phenomena. This is the middle path it aims to walk. To try and put this very confusing topic a little bit more simply. For Madhyamaka, emptiness is the absence of intrinsic existence within appearances.

For Advaita Vedanta, fullness is the presence of an intrinsically existent ground beneath appearances, and for Yogacara, Suchness is the presence of the absence itself, which is a pure, immediate, empty fullness we can say nothing about. So, Suchness is not nothing, so there is a weak implication involved here.

And in later teachings this unspoken implication was associated with the teachings on Buddha nature, which describe a pure and unchanging luminous potential that is immanent in all beings, and which could be interpreted in a similar way to Brahman if you have no problem with the extreme of essentialism, which Buddhists of course do, so don’t do it.

Moreover, if we are interpreting Brahman as something we can affirm as an ultimate spiritual substance, then it cannot be the same as Suchness, which transcends concepts–this would directly contradict the universal Buddhist teaching on no-self. But if we are interpreting Brahman as also beyond all concepts, then it’s a lot more difficult to say what is the difference.

Indeed, we cannot say anything if we don’t have any concepts. And because there is no ultimately accurate way to conceptually frame the difference between two things that are beyond conceptualization, we naturally see the tendency, even in Buddhism, to emphasize the positive aspect of this something that is beyond characterization–this is the only logical alternative to absolute silence, which isn’t always very instructive.

The Chinese monk Paramatha for instance promoted the idea that there is a level of consciousness beneath the alaya-vijnana called the “amala-vijnana”, which means “stainless consciousness”, implying that all appearances are like stains on an underlying ultimate suchness. Sounds a bit like Maya superimposed onto Brahman.

Alright, let’s now focus on the relation between Madhyamika and Yogacara a little more closely. The main difference between these schools, as we have seen, is how they characterize the concept of emptiness. For Madhyamika, emptiness is the absence of intrinsic existence; for Yogacara, emptiness is the absence of subject-object duality.

Madhyamaka is basically saying that the ultimate truth is that no conceptions are ultimately true, and Yogacara is saying that the nondual realization of this is the ultimate truth. To put this another way, Madhyamika is explicitly saying that the ultimate reality is an absence of presence of intrinsic existence—that nothing has intrinsic existence—while Yogacara is implicitly saying that the ultimate reality is the presence of the absence of intrinsic existence—that emptiness has extrinsic existence.

That is, emptiness is the nature of that which is empty, and that which is empty is consciousness, or at the most basic level, the alaya-vijnana, which is actually more like the Western unconscious. This is not a perfect analogy, but if we were to try and express the relation between Madhyamaka and Yogacara in paraphilosophical terms, we might say that both Madhyamaka and Yogacara acknowledge the interdependence of the quadrants of the dialectical matrix, but while Madhyamaka emphasizes the ultimate untruth of the matrix, calling us to reject it in favor of that which is beyond perspective—the parajective—Yogacara emphasizes that the relative truth of the quadrants of the matrix all appear within consciousness, calling us to recognize consciousness without its function of categorization, a bit like the panjective.

I think both traditions recognise that there is no difference between the parajective and the panjective–they’re just emphasizing different things. Yogacara is saying that when we cease from separating things into categories, mind and matter, consciousness and appearance, everything is seen as interfused and nondual—there is just this Suchness.

Madhyamaka is simply going a little bit further in this exercise by critically stripping away the subjective experience of Suchness, reminding us that this too is empty of intrinsic existence. Madhyamaka is concerned that by emphasizing the presence and ultimate nature of consciousness, Yogacara risks reifying consciousness as an intrinsically existent substance, contradicting the Buddhist doctrine of no-self.

Interestingly, the criticism that Adi Shankara makes of Yogacara, from the Advaita perspective, is that Yogacara risks annihilating reality as a discontinuous process. That is, if consciousness and appearances are nondual, then consciousness is momentary and discontinuous just as appearances are momentary and discontinuous.

Advaita believes there must be something constant underlying all change. Nevertheless, both Madhyamika and Yogacara saw themselves to be espousing the genuine philosophy of the middle way, which is that which avoids any bias towards the view that there is absolutely no self on the one hand, and that there is a permanent self on the other, which in the context of paraphilosophy could be related to abjectivism and superjectivism respectively (also ob-sub).

Yogacara says that phenomena are appearances of consciousness, lacking independent reality as appearances, but also that consciousness is not an independent ultimate reality and is rather the ultimate nature of phenomena themselves, devoid of subject-object duality. Madhyamika says that phenomena are conventionally real as dependently arisen appearances, but that nothing is ultimately real.

Madhyamika emphasizes the relativity of the phenomenal world, while Yogacara emphasizes the primacy of consciousness. Again, Yogacara could be characterized as focusing on the presence of absence, which is the suchness of immediate conscious experience, in the sense that consciousness is the thing that is empty of duality.

Madhyamika could be characterized as focusing on the absence of presence, which is emptiness, in the sense that emptiness is the lack of anything that has inherent existence. For this reason, Yogacara has questioned whether Madhyamika is subtly favoring non-existence and nihilism and annihilationism, while Madhyamika has questioned whether Yogacara is subtly favoring existence and essentialism and eternalism.

And the difference is ultimately due to the limitations of language and concepts. We know that the ultimate teaching is silence, and we know that humans need to make noise, even if the purpose of that noise is to help others find silence. So, what we must try to understand is that the Yogacarans realize in a subtle way that their consciousness is not a permanent substance; that the Madhyamikas realize in a subtle way that their emptiness is not the total lack of anything existent; and that these two recognitions are two complementary ways of approaching something that is very difficult to convey in a rational manner, because it’s not, in fact, rational at all.

Reality is neither entirely real nor unreal, and we cannot express this. If we just say “reality is,” then we imply intrinsic existence, and if we just say “reality is not,” then we deny that something is appearing. But if you were to begin with Madhyamaka and then ensure that your understanding was not that emptiness is the total lack of existence, and if you were to begin with Yogacara and then ensure that your understanding was not that consciousness was the presence of absolute existence, then I think you would arrive at the same place, though we can only talk about this place from these two different angles, which in themselves can indeed appear subtly nihilist or essentialist respectively.

And so, what we’re dancing around here is the true meaning of the middle way. It is that which the dialectical process orbits around. It is a point of balance that is simultaneously necessary and impossible, because the very nature of the mind and understanding is to lean to one side more than the other.

You can only get there without concepts, which means we must stop trying to conceive the inconcievable. The ultimate truth is the middle of all extremes. More than that, it's beyond the middle—it is paraphilosophy—but any attempt to explain this truth will lean to the left or to the right—it will be philosophy to some degree or another.

Any conception of the middle won’t be truly in the middle. The best we can do is accept a contradiction, though we’d better deny it as well, because in fact the opposites are not even distinguishable. And as we have seen, there are also two ways that we can express paraphilosophy, or that we can conceptualize that which is beyond philosophy.

On the one hand, paraphilosophy is the self-reference of the dialectical matrix–the consciousness of perspective–but on the other hand, it is the negation of the dialectical matrix. These two representations are themselves nondual. The presence of perspective is the appearance of the absence of perspective, and the ultimate truth is that presence and absence go together.

That is because the ultimate truth is freedom, and freedom is the absence of a way things must be that allows for the presence of the way things are. Our experience of the world already is a positive expression of emptiness, because it is the nature of emptiness—or perhaps its lack of nature—which allows for our entire world of fullness.

Emptiness is the passive condition of creativity. And if we can understand that creation is not something different from this creative power—that the bond between the absence of essence and the presence of appearance is itself a kind of meta-essence that goes beyond the conceptual duality of existence vs.

non-existence, then we can also begin to understand how in a more culturally religious setting, this indeterminate suchness might be thought of as divine. And that's it for this video. In the next video, we’ll be taking a closer look at the Advaita tradition and its doctrine of Maya. In particular, we’ll be discussing the status of phenomena reality in Advaita as compared to Madhyamaka and other interpretations of the Vedanta, and a potential problem with combining the idea of the world as illusion with the idea of an attributeless absolute.

Again, please consider supporting me if this is possible for you, and I look forward to seeing you back next time.
