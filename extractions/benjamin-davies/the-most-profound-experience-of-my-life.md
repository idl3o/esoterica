## Transcript

I really want you to watch this I'm quite sure that the information I have to share in this video has never been shared in such a clear and comprehensive way before and that it is fundamental to human wisdom health and happiness this is not philosophy it's not spirituality this is reality recently I had the most significant experience of my life and that's saying a lot because I've had a lot of significant experiences recently I escaped from a rabbit hole I've been crawling down for almost 12 years and today I'm going to explain it all it's going to be a fairly long video because I want to get everything out in one big fat lump of insight so I wouldn't blame you if you can't stare at a screen for this long listen while you're on a walk or while driving or while meditating to begin I'm going to give a little backstory because I think it's important to fully comprehend why I'm speaking so boldly as to the importance of all this if you really want to jump to a certain section then I'll provide a load of timestamps in the description though I would implore you to listen to the entire thing so how did this all begin I think I can trace the developments that have occurred within me back to when I was was 18 years old and I'd just moved to London I was living with a bunch of people who had also left home for the first time and everyone around me developed a singular shared hobby cannabis at first it was just something that made playing video games and talking with friends about stupid stuff more fun but after a while it started to change me not in any overtly obvious way but it shifted my attention more and more from the outside world to the inside world I became less interested in material things and I became more interested in ideas it unlocked a capacity for introspection that had until then remained dormant it also unlocked a fear sense of compassion and empathy in me and I remember spending hours weeping over videos of Random Acts of human kindness or for a while videos of dogs reacting to soldiers coming home from deployment from my experience cannabis works as a kind of magnifier of attention and this ability to focus in really deeply on something is a skill that eventually stays with you it made me more aware of how my body felt and it made me aware of the connection between feelings and thoughts I was always an extremist and a perfectionist in my interests everything I did I wanted to go to the core of that thing and I wanted to go to the core of whatever the most important thing to go to the core of is it was over this time that I learned that that thing is not outside but inside the reason I'm mentioning this is that for a long time I played down the significance of this period on my future experiences so I think it's important to admit to it now I don't think that cannabis is a Surefire method of gaining access to the deeper levels of introspection as cannabis use is much more widespread than intelligence is but it can be if you are already that way inclined it certainly did something because after a while I couldn't use the plant anymore without having extremely intense and uncomfortable experiences as though my brain had literally gotten better at getting high whatever this neurological skill is I think it is connected to the ability for deep introspection and it may serve a similar function as Insight Meditation maybe anyway after about a year of increasing introspection when I was 19 I had a profound experience while reading a book on physics a first Glimpse at the ultimate truth of life I've described this experience elsewhere so I won't elaborate excessively here but essentially all of the nihilistic beliefs that I thought were rational and Justified were obliterated in this experience and all that remained was an absolute conviction that I had glimpsed something of unparalleled importance that there was a profundity to existence that lay beneath the rational thought I previously valued so highly and all it took was to experience this just once for me to become totally obsessed with it it was like a forgotten memory and I suddenly UND what I was meant to do I saw it to be the solution to everything and the only worthy object of my attention I became addicted to it because as a young materialist who didn't even know what the word spirituality meant I had no context for the experience and I couldn't fully understand it and thus I needed to return to it so that I could clasp it more tightly and then never let it go so that I could share the truth with all the World somehow I just knew that if people understood this truth that I barely understood myself then all the world's problems would vanish I knew that it is possible to experience this truth that it is beyond ideas and theories the fact that there was and is so much Injustice and cruelty in the world must be the result of delusion not evil delusion so I thought I needed to do something about this people just haven't had a chance to see clearly so I needed to help them obviously this was all incredibly naive but the decision to at least try to see how far I get was the only option because nothing else fundamentally mattered I was simply instantly addicted I was steadfast on reaching this ultimate truth and I knew that I would do nothing else in life but Focus on finding a way to share it with the world indeed this is how I have spent the last 11 and a half years trying to scrape by while focusing on my mission anyone who knows me will emphatically confirm this I've done exactly what I decided I would do in that moment and everything else has been a distraction or a disturbance in the Years following this experience and there were many more along the way I proceeded to recreate my insights from the ground up within an analytical philosophical system the system you probably know me for on this channel parap philosophy I could not expect the academics to trust any personal anecdotes of mystical insights so I had to prove it in their own language parap philosophy is my attempt to reach the truth from the other side of the Divide between pure knowing and rational thought never nevertheless the final understanding is not any intellectual system it is to free oneself from intellectual systems it is a return to the foundations of Reason before we got lost in all these intellectual theories as to what is right and wrong good and bad true and false it is what the Indian philosophers have called Liberation but the Indian philosophers have typically emphasized Liber Liberation from suffering and never has it been an interest or concern of mine to become liberated from suffering I wanted understanding not peace and as it would turn out this flaw would actually be my greatest strength mystical insight and peace seemed to me to be in completely opposite directions mystical Insight is an extreme State well peace is a state of balance and so I was actively running away from Liberation by chasing Insight I was diving head first into desire and attachment and suffering it therefore never occurred to me to preoccupy myself with any kind of spiritual Doctrine especially one from outside my own culture and conditioning which was essentially scientific I never considered myself to be on what one might call a spiritual path I simply wanted to capture the essence of my own direct experiences so that I could share it with the world this was as deep as it went for me to introduce ideologies and labels was beside the point the only thing I could rely on was my own ability to continue down this path of understanding I did not care if the path led to peace I did not care if it led to suffering I've had the same sort of peak experience innumerable times over the years in all sorts of different circumstances they are brief and they seem to become more intense every time I have one there's been some research on the neurobiology of mystical experiences recently which seems to be in alignment with my experiences subjectively the Research indicates that they are caused by or correlated with the co-activation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems which interest inly K Yung claimed were identical to the unconscious mind the results is a state of rapidly increasing internal awareness that is correlated with rapidly increasing physical excitation the mystical quality of the insights appears to result from how they are ingrained into the physical state you are feeling that is the insights are not just thought but physically experienced it is is therefore quite understandable why in more archaic times such experiences might be interpreted as messages from God as they do not originate from one's own conscious reasoning capacity but from the unconscious we should also be aware of how such experiences are naturally colored by one's cultural conditioning and beliefs and since it is a peak experience you do not remain at the peak of understanding you forget it in just the same way that you gradually forget what a certain scent smells like after it is removed of course you do form memories about it which you can use to form a description of the experience but those memories are not the same as the smell itself so the real thrust of my addiction has been the desire to recover enough memories of this experience that I am satisfied enough to be able to convey it in an understandable and useful way as such there are highly nuanced levels of understanding to the mystical insight and the closer you get to its Essence the harder it is to recover memories that accurately capture it we'll get into the deeper stuff in a little bit but for now let me provide a very simple overview of the highest level of the realization as it will help you to understand the situation I've been in over the past decade there is a state of Stillness within us where some part of ourselves is totally accepting of everything that is happening in my very early notes I referred to this as coolness and there is also a state of agitation where a part of ourselves resists the Stillness and tries to apprehend things I initially called this simply cringe we can be agitated to apprehend the agit itself or we can be agitated to apprehend the Stillness though this isn't exactly the same thing one way to imagine these two things is by thinking about those times we have trouble falling asleep one part of us is embracing sleep but another part of us is still clinging to wakefulness these two states depend on each other they only exist in opposition to each other like light and dark therefore the more we see experience as something to apprehend the less we are integrated into it this is cringe and the more we are integrated the less we care to apprehend this is cool this might seem totally unremarkable and if it does that's good I don't want to confuse things too quickly however I should also add that one also recognizes in the mystical experience that the Insight does not simply concern the nature of One's Own Self but also the fundamental nature of reality that is one recognizes that reality at the most General level is undergoing the very same process of striving to understand its own basic Stillness by becoming agitated I will explain this all thoroughly later the way to realize one's own basic coolness and we should probably use a better term now like peace is to stop being agitated which means to stop indulging in our agitation but also to stop trying not to be agitated as all trying is a form of agitation this is why I used the term coolness at first as one cannot try to be cool it must come naturally just like peace and given that these realizations about oneself mirrored by realizations about reality it becomes clear from the mystical Insight that to understand the nature of ourselves goes along with understanding the nature of reality as such to increase our psychological and physical health is to increase our instinctive awareness of the ultimate truth so that the foundation of a true science of philosophy must be psychology and biology it is in this that science and spirituality will one day be United okay that's a good foundation we're now ready to go deeper thank you so much for paying attention so far it will be useful here to mention a distinction I've discussed before on this channel between two basic feelings that can motivate Us in life righteousness is the feeling one has when focused on apprehending the ultimate nature of reality and opposed to it is pleasure which is the feeling one has when focused on apprehending the sensory world don't get too stuck on the words righteousness and pleasure these are just labels and one can feel either regardless of what one is focused on the key difference is that the former facilitates our interest in understanding the moral significance of human existence while the latter facilitates our interest in the more worldly practical significance of human existence so there is a loose analogy here again to spirituality versus science this isn't to say that scientists are all hedonists but that it's the same kind of motivation that leads one to care more about one's physical state as it is to care more about the physical nature of the world as opposed to the moral state of the same we might also think of righteousness as the attempt to apprehend the Stillness within us and pleasure as the attempt to indulge in our agitation but both are forms of agitation and both can motivate us to take certain actions in life peace is thus the opposite of both these things it is not trying to apprehend either the ultimate or immediate reality the path to peace therefore has to do with where one places one's attention in one's mind how one exercises one's capacity to believe in ideas and how One Associates with the feelings of one's body it is a point of balance between both righteousness and pleasure where we are not seeking to lean more in One Direction than the other mystical experiences are therefore not the path to peace because they are concerned with apprehending the nature of Ultimate Reality which fuels the feeling of righteousness nevertheless the mystical experience is a window to the path it reveals what and where the path is but it itself is the opposite of the path it is a form of agitation the mystical experience is therefore in part a realization that that very realization is not Liberation and when you know what isn't the path you can now see what is in this way agitation is necessary for the realization of Stillness just as Stillness is necessary for agitation again they are interdependent and complimentary so again righteousness makes us feel like we are apprehending the fundamental nature of reality as in spirituality or religion and pleasure makes us feel like we are apprehending the immediate nature of sensory experience as in science to find peace one needs to walk the fine line between righteousness and pleasure which for me would obviously mean to stop being so addicted to righteousness and the mystical knowledge I am sharing with you now which is actually giving me the solution to the problem I am creating by discovering that very solution we shall see that wisdom is like a feedback loop of desire in this sense but again I was never interested in peace all I wanted was to be able to share the truth with others because if everyone found the truth then everyone would be at peace and all the world's problems would be solved in the generation this was my lofty goal and for all all I knew at the start I could have been the only person who'd be able to do it so I simply had to stay devoted you see the path to peace is the most natural thing in the world to access but it's also the last thing in the world we would ever consider as the solution to give up trying we have a tendency to run away from the path as fast as we can at the earliest opportunity we get we feel we need to grow up we imagine all these things we need to do it's not that goals or Ambitions and indeed Duties are at all a problem it's our addiction to our goals the sense that we simply must achieve them in order to be satisfied this is the problem and the reason we don't realize that the most natural path is the solution to everything is because it's literally no solution because only when there is no solution can there be no problem to solve we are bound to become problem makers and problem solvers we think that to achieve something we need to do something in order to achieve it and we never consider that our need to get something is the opposite of already having what we need maybe some of you understand this already but it is completely counter to ordinary human behavior and Instinct and for this reason there are really only two ways for Humanity to be able to find this solution even though it is hidden in plain sight either you can be told by someone who has discovered it through mystical experience or you can Discover it yourself through your own mystical experience either way at least until the Other Extreme of pleasure and science succeeds on its own path righteousness and particularly mysticism which is the absolute extreme of addiction and thus the opposite of peace is our only means to discovering this truth without it we are perpetually students or Seekers mysticism is therefore a wounder that heals itself a poison that cures itself and this is not just a fitting metaphor the mystical knowledge is precisely an understanding of the unity of opposites so naturally it is both a blessing and a curse and only at the very depths of desire and suffering is that curse transmuted into a blessing and only those who are willing and able to suffer deeply are able to see the journey to its end it's not about being a genius it's not about being spiritual the key to attainment is a moral willingness to sacrifice yourself for the sake of knowledge and I'm sure there have been countless thousands of individuals throughout history who have discovered the path to peace through their own Relentless desire some we know about most we probably don't and we should be aware that discovering the path does not necessarily mean that that individual will end up walking it discovering it is only the beginning the most obvious example of such a discovery is clearly the case of the historical Buddha as the tradition which developed from his Discovery explicitly emphasizes a middle way which is a spiritual path that steers clear of both extreme asceticism and sensual Indulgence this is no coincidence if you decide to become a Buddhist then you will be taught how to get on the path and keep your balance the standard Buddhist path is a path that entirely avoids the danger of becoming addicted to righteousness but if you do not have a teacher or you do not attend to any teachings then you shall have to be fully devoted and addicted to righteousness which means shunning balance and shunning what you would otherwise have been taught I have learned through my experiences that a Mystic is essentially a person who has likely unintentionally trained their nervous system to work in a certain way an unbalanced way and so as I mentioned already there is a physiological mechanism going on in the production of mystical insights a large component of these insights is rooted in one's awareness of the literal lack of balance in one's nervous system one's own lack of coolness which has allowed them to reach this peculiar State of Consciousness and these physical Sensations are translated into insights the Insight that balance not just in one's conscious beliefs but at the most basic level of our attitude towards physical sensation excitement and apathy is the key to achieving Liberation from suffering it is the same energy that produces both thrill and anxiety the difference is in perception and acceptance it is in this way that the poison becomes the cure to realize that balance is the key you must first lose your balance you must first create a problem that needs to be solved the biggest problem imaginable the question of the ultimate truth and you must need to then solve this problem more than you need to survive it is also for this reason that cannabis can move a person deeper down the path of righteousness because it has the ability to literally throw your nervous system off balance it accelerates you down the path of wherever your attention is focused this is why in rare cases can activate a latent schizophrenia it is an accelerant and magnifier of experience I wouldn't be surprised if certain extreme aesthetic practices like fasting and sleep deprivation also do the same so anyone that discovers this on their own must walk the lonely path of righteousness which means you must have an extremely strong desire a desire that exceeds yourself to Encompass the entire world and this path is painful you would not do this to yourself if there were not some greater goal hence the motivating feeling for this path is righteousness as opposed to pleasure and as opposed to peace and for anyone who stumbles upon the ultimate truth like I have done you shall need to understand it completely in order to trust it completely do not think that I have not had my doubts it was my uncertainty that kept me so addicted to righteousness to fill in every last Gap in my understanding I would not accept doubt and this is the sickness that you can only Cure by going deeper and deeper into it the only way out of the Abyss is through it and so I tell you the truth since December of 2012 I've been in a days my mind has been lost to this vision of the ultimate truth I've not turned my stare from it for a second I've been obsessed I've needed to close the gap and recently I had another experience and I have now filled that Gap I'm fully satisfied for the first time ever that there is nothing to gain from my obession with righteousness I feel like I've been staring through a slit in some curtains and now the curtains have been pulled apart I understand the solution to all this mess as humans find ourselves within the solution is to engage with righteousness as much as we can to take interest in the nature of ourselves without becoming addicted to it where addiction is is simply the conception and inclination that there is something that we need to do for it is these inclinations that subconsciously train our bodies to function in a certain way again this doesn't mean to do nothing it means to do everything without needing to do it and this is a huge difference because it is not ultimately our actions that affect our state of being it is how and why we Act the trick is to get rid of the why and to realize that the only valid why is why not for as you will realize true compassion does not arise from a why from a duty it comes from a why not from a deeper inclination to do things we do not need to do I'll explain this more later the solution is to stay balanced because balance is the only state in which there is no addiction and where there is no desire to perpetuate the belief in and attachment to an ultimate or immediate reality where we favor neither righteousness nor pleasure it is not an intellectual thing it is a state of being in which we do not overly stimulate our body and brain by needing to do and know too much nor do we overly dull it by by doing and knowing too little human existence is basically a game of Risk versus reward of how much of yourself you're willing to risk in order to get the most reward and in order to get the maximum reward which is Liberation you need to take the maximum possible risk without risking too much you need to get the balance just right and this is what I call the path of balance or what the Buddhists call the middle way between the extremes of addiction to righteousness and addiction to pleasure between self mortification and self-indulgence asceticism and Hedonism it is the absolute middle path between them not just slightly in the middle you have to not be able to get any closer to righteousness without becoming addicted and hence it is quite literally a state of nonattachment because attachment is discrimination and discrimination goes one way and not the other righteousness and striving can and should be a part of your life it just cannot dominate your life it must be exactly 50% any less and you are too close to righteousness you can risk more anymore and you are too close to pleasure you need to risk less but now remember what I said about the mystical experience earlier the idea of risk versus reward is not just about the Perfection of human experience it is about reality itself it is why and how reality exists and this becomes more and more clear the closer you get to this peak this is the core of the mystical insight and it's the thing I've been trying to rationalize for many years you'll understand that it's not something that is particularly easy to articulate but I think I can do it now I'll have to use some analogies to help us first consider risky jokes at 0% risk the joke is really wholesome and safe so it's not funny and at 100% risk it is purely offensive and crude so it's also not funny at 50% the balance between sensitivity and offensiveness is perfect and so it is most funny but if you go over 50% the joke fails 50% is the limit Perfection and essence of humor now consider a futuristic simulation or a video game at 0% realism the game is not fun because there are no consequences for failure it's too safe at 100% realism the game is not fun because the consequence for failure is death it's too dangerous at 50% realism the balance between safety and danger is perfect so it is most fun but if you go over 50% the game fails to be fun 50% is the limit Perfection and essence of fun and finally consider how close we come to failing at a task based on how risky it was and where anything over 50% ends with failure in this case we're thinking about how much of a role optimism plays in our success at 0% risk there is no point in being optimistic because there is no chance of failure at 100% risk there is also no point in being optimistic because there is no chance of success there is only value in optimism when it is not certain that we will succeed or fail at 50% risk when the ratio of risk to reward is greatest there is most value in optimism so there is a direct connection between the degree of success and the importance of optimism and the essence of optimism is the perfect balance between reward and risk now the point of these examples is to highlight an important quality of the peak of absolute perfection freedom the ability to make a choice is connected to how close things are to being in balance at the extremes there is no choice between optimism or pessimism safety or danger because things are certain as risk gets closer to 50% the ambiguity of Which choice is better increases as does the value and usefulness of our optimism and when the chances for and against our success are perfectly imbalance the value of optimism is greatest because optimism is a striving for Success it wants success well pessimism is not a striving for failure it does not want failure the former is an active emotion while the latter is passive so the when things could go either way down to the very last atom of causality when there is nothing left to influence the outcome then there is total freedom as to whether we shall be optimistic or pessimistic and the question is which shall we choose to strive for success or to fear failure the answer is that we should choose optim ISM because it is better to expect the good and be disappointed half the time than it is to expect the bad and be surprised half the time if there was a truly free choice life would decide for Success because success is full of life and failure is empty of it so what I'm trying to highlight is that there is a sort of emotional Freedom at play in all these examples that pequs at the perfect balance between success and failure this freedom is connected to humor fun the power of optimism and indeed Liberation all right hopefully these analogies will serve the purpose I want for them we're now going to consider reality remember we were originally talking about how Liberation is the perfect balance between righteousness and pleasure and how in the mystical experience we recognize that the same thing can be said about reality itself so first imagine that nothing exists consider that our Spectrum from 0 to 100% risk represents a field of potential all the possible ways that the physical world could be if it existed the closer to 0% the more impossible is the creation of life because there would be too much emptiness or just non-existence and as we move closer to 100% the creation of life would also become impossible because there would be too much fullness or just pure and total existence without any room for structure at 50% the conditions for life and Consciousness are perfect now in our previous analogy the Middle Point separated reasons to be optimistic from reasons to be pessimistic here it separates reasons for life and reasons for no life in the mystical Insight these are experienced as the same thing thus when emptiness and fullness are perfectly balanced there is no mechanistic reason for why there should or should not be life if that version of reality actually existed the reasons for and against are perfectly equal and thus there is an infinitesimal gap of Freedom a choice that can be made and if there shall be no life then no choice could be made and if there shall be life then a choice could be made and there could be life only if it would choose to exist if given the choice which it would do because optimism is greater than pessimism and to live is greater than to not because pessimism and non-existence do not will for themselves only life does that this freedom is the true meaning of Enlightenment nothing is the structure of what could be if there was something and what could be includes both something and nothing existence and non-existence as both are possible in the middle of this spectrum is a peak and this peak must be the essence of existence because the essence of existence increases the closer it is to non-existence more risk more reward and more importantly more value because the peak is the point at which that which would favor existence has the freedom to tip the scales in its favor because existence is alive and active while non-existence is inert and passive this peak of perfect balance is the only point at which nothing can become something because pure existence is too determined pure non-existence does not exist and it is only by having the freedom to fail that there is also the freedom to succeed the reasons for and against existence are perfectly equal as are the reasons as to whether it is worth our suffering to live so the only thing that could possibly decide between them are their consequences which are thus also their causes the consequence and cause of existence is the drive for existence well the consequence and cause of non-existence is nothing existence is better because life has decided it we do not have to be we chose to be because it is better to be because to be is to be free because we do not have to be the option not to be is the foundation of being and the free choice to be is what we ultimately are so just as the liberation of human beings is a moral Freedom between extremes the existence and Enlightenment of reality itself is a moral Freedom between extremes life and reality Enlightenment and existence are precisely the same thing recall in our previous example the value of optimism increases with risk with the closer it is to its opposite pessimism the same is true for humor and fun and Beauty virtue love and all those things that are fundamental to human nature these things are the foundation and essence of existence and evolution they are the infinitesimal edge that being has over non-being they are what we all are at a fundamental level a primordial enlightened loving Blissful willful awareness the most valuable thing that is possible the inevitable Miracle of Life and so we are not simply talking about a physicalistic probability for life with this spectrum we might do better to think of the spectrum between non-existence and existence as reflecting the drive for life to exist too little drive too much non-existence too much drive too much existence only by being unattached to non-existence or existence is their freedom and the possibility of Enlightenment I hope this made at least a tiny bit of sense to you and I know I'm going to become a lot better at explaining this part as time goes on but I really wanted to include it in this video this is the ultimate core of the mystical experience and what I've been trying so hard to bring back just so that I could share it with you it is a memory the memory that long long ago I we chose to exist for the good okay future Ben here I don't know what you think but I'm not super happy with that explanation I don't think the key idea is very clear so I'm going to add in a few more words to complicate it all even further feel free to skip forward if you are already satisfied so righteousness is an obsession with the ultimate nature of reality it just wants to understand the truth and it is detached from emotional affect goodness or Badness pleasure is an Indulgence in emotion and physicality and the ability to experience things as either good or bad it accepts the risk of suffering for the potential of Joy Liberation is the point at which there is an equal amount of safety Detachment from feeling and risk identification with feeling this balance allows for total freedom of feeling it is unconditioned because the there are equal reasons for it to embrace emotion or reject emotion there is thus a necessary point of indeterminancy within the structure of potential where neither non-existence nor existence are predetermined this point is the epitome or quintessence of potential in the same way that it was the essence of humor fun and value in the earlier analogies this p peak of value is the ground of reality it is the thing that is actually aware of the possibilities either side of itself because there can only be value when there is awareness it is a moral quality the reason that our world of Duality and indeed suffering arises is due to the attractive nature of the sensation of pleasure and the moral sense of goodness the peak is like a light that illuminates the center of the spectrum but it also illuminates Beyond itself with its awareness to the side of non-existence there is no emotion and so there is no reaction between the potential and awareness but to the side of existence there is emotion and so there is a reaction between the awareness and the potential for feeling and so there is both attraction and repulsion to existence an experience of good and bad and since optimism is infinitesimally more powerful than pessimism and goodness more powerful than Badness attachment and intention develop within this area of the spectrum and this is the cause of our world and the self-perpetuating cycle of addiction The Liberation of individual beings that have become addicted to emotion contributes to the power power and value of this primordial Consciousness in a feedback loop that resonates itself into being individuals become liberated from addiction as reality awakens from the potential for addiction the two arise together and this is why Enlightenment is even possible in humans because it is the same experience as the creation of reality because it is a reunion with real ity from the separation of addiction at least it's something like that when one experiences this fundamental truth about the nature of oneself it is experienced in the language of feelings because it is not an intellectual realization of the truth it is a literal reliving of the actual process of the emergence of emotionality from the primordial enlightenment as such it's a tricky thing to put into words we've now reached the final leg and we're going to go even deeper but the following should help you to understand everything better and also give you some practical advice on how to realize all this for yourself first understand that Human Experience the experience we have of our own existence is a skill to be developed it is a skill to have a perception of a world and the development of this skill is reflected in the evolution of life and in the separation of subjectivity and objectivity Enlightenment is the basic Natural State the ultimate thing that exists everything else our perceptions and development come on top of Enlightenment they are skills to be developed to go back to something I mentioned much earlier Enlightenment is the unchanging Stillness within us the coolness and the skill is the evolving agitation within us the cringe the skill is the thing that is evolving and the physical world is its outwards expression just as psychology is its inwards expression the skill to experience is developed by our focus on a given aspect of experience and so our focus is a creative act the more skill we have at experiencing and believing in and rationalizing something the more real that thing appears to us the better able we are to see how it must be true the cause of all human experience is an attraction to this skill of producing experience and there are two ways that we can exercise this skill because there are two basic directions for our attention to flow in and because there are two basic Sensations that can motivate our Focus we can be skilled at experiencing and believing in and seeing the reality of the world outside us and we are motivated to develop this skill via the feeling of pleasure or more generally by a kind of practical satisfaction or we can be skilled at experiencing and believing in and seeing the reality of the ultimate truth of existence as in the mystical insight and we are motivated to develop this skill via the feeling of righteousness or more generally by a kind of moral satisfaction there is no immediate World nor ultimate truth outside our ability to produce the experience of an immediate world and an ultimate truth these two skills are complementary to each other again we learn this in the mystical experience and the physical counterpart to this complimentarity is the overe excitation or over inhibition of the nervous system and since they are compliment mement to develop one of the skills is to become deficient in the other and if you know anything about yion psychology this is simply to say that one of the skills becomes consciously controlled while the other becomes a part of the unconscious Shadow our preference for these skills therefore exists on a spectrum this is probably where we get those theories of things like the planes of existence and because it is a spectrum there is a center to the Spectrum which represents the point at which one favors neither of the skills this Center is the ground of our ability to experience and from this ground our desire can extend in two different directions which are the skills at this ground there is neither an identification with the immediate World nor an ultimate truth for these things are recognized to exist only in complementary opposition to each other and so the ground is an emptiness it is without a conception that there is an independent individual identity to experience the immediate or the ultimate now curiously this ground this position of balance we can Unite with in our experience is the ultimate truth that righteousness seeks yet righteousness goes off towards the extreme of the ultimate it runs away from balance so how is it that it can produce a mystical experience that does indeed reveal the ultimate truth it is that the extreme of existence and balance are the same or in other words the Ultimate Reality is complimentarity I've discussed this extensively Elsewhere on this channel so I won't elaborate here but the point is that when the Mystic perfects their ability to imagine this extreme of the Ultimate Reality their vision of some Transcendent creative principle or God or whatever the Mystic believes in transforms into a vision of the true Ultimate Reality which is the perfect balance between all extremes they have stepped outside the bounds of dualistic thinking and thus there is a hidden third skill which is the skill to not develop any skill which is the skill to not perpetuate the experience of belief in and ultimately creation of further experience it is the skill to avoid the addiction to any kind of bias or one-sidedness and thus we could call it the master skill it is the Perfection of our ability to experience it is Liberation the master skill is beyond Duty and desire it is the state of human experience in the absence of Duty and desire for when Duty and desire stop our nervous system comes into balance our beliefs and intentions come into balance our body and mind finds Harmony and we see clearly what we basically are it is only the development of the Lesser skills that conceals this truth while also being that which reveals it again the poison is the cure now both the skills motivated by righteousness and pleasure give us a kind of high or sense of fulfillment or sense of self it is this high that leads us to continue developing that skill to increase our righteousness to increase our pleasure the more you are skilled in one the less you will be skilled in the other and again the opposite skill will become an unconscious complex that will influence your experience in undesirable ways this is the cause of suffering you become a one-sided being and this one-sidedness is what I call addiction the reason that addiction leads to suffering is that each extreme is essentially supported by its opposite and so the ability to manage the high we get from our addiction is determined by how much the opposite addiction is developed so the more extreme our addiction the less we are able to cope with that addiction because the less we have developed its opposite it is in this way that the perpetuation of experience which is caused by addiction or what the Eastern philosophers have called karma is in a very literal sense bound to the presence of suffering perhaps this is an oversimplification but I believe it was the book himself who said that life is suffering and this is in absolutely no way a pessimistic view it is literally true that any High any active enjoyment is compensated by an equal and opposite low which is suffering the Buddha could just as well have said that life is satisfying but this wouldn't have gotten the point across that the path to peace and Bliss which is a much deeper nonu form of enjoyment is to reduce the distance between our highs and lows until they are united and then keep balanced as we raise the homeostatic Baseline of our ability to feel that Bliss this is the true middle way for example a person addicted to pleasure just wants to feel good in the immediate moment caring not for the future and they will not have the Integrity discipline passion motivation and purpose required to control their desire for pleasure which will lead to emotional distress ignorance a lack of personal development and a lack of meaning in life they are not taking life seriously enough a person addicted to righteousness just wants to make progress on a long-term Mission caring not for the present and they will not have the Vitality strength energy stamina and composure required to fuel their desire for righteousness which will lead to physical exhaustion anxiety a lack of personal fulfillment and a lack of appreciation for life they are taking life too seriously there are complex but fully explainable mechanisms that play here rooted in Psych physical disturbances that are caused by these Addictions on the physical side of things they affect the regulation of our neurotransmitters our autonomic nervous system our immune system and I suspect even the expression of our genes and the Insidious part of suffering in this way is that since we suffer in regard to the skill we are deficient in or unconscious of we are not particularly conscious of our suffering we ignore it we think it's a normal part of life but it's not just because you do not care about being insensitive or exhausted does not mean that those things are not limiting you so in order to eliminate suffering the skill of physical health and pleasure and the skill of moral health and righteousness need to be balance no good being a heartless hero no good being a frail philosopher it is balance which allows us to compensate for the highs that pleasure and righteousness produce and which prevents us from becoming addicted to either to power to knowledge in mild cases of addiction the solution is relatively straightforward one must learn to become aware of the importance of the oppos opposite skill in one's life which will literally alter the physical and ideological stresses you habitually place on your body and mind or you can directly attenuate the homeostasis of your body and mind through various forms of meditation but an extreme addiction to righteousness particularly one that has been empowered through significant mystical experiences is a much more difficult condition to cure and that is because the cause of one's addiction is one's recognition of the solution to that addiction remember the ultimate ground of being is the state of balance or complimentarity or interdependence or a Unity of opposites and righteousness is simultaneously the intense focus on the truth of the state of balance yet this focus is itself a state of disbalance because you cannot get it when you are trying hard to get it the righteousness addict is therefore perfectly willing to endure the suffering it brings because they perceive suffering to be a noble price to pay for their Enlightenment but since the ultimate truth is the absence of addiction not the addiction to the absence of addiction this Noble goal is ultimately a self-perpetuating delusion that's right the ultimate wisdom is also the ultimate delusion but this is critical the function of mysticism is fundamental to reality not only is it a consequence of the self-referential nature of reality but it is also the only way that life can recognize its own delusion and realize its true nature nature it is the Perfection of addiction suffering and delusion indeed the Mystic has reached a point in their journey of self-development at which there is no possibility of regression this is true but I certainly would not recommend it to anyone much better to get on the selfless path and keep your balance the more you focus on righteousness the more you need to cure your addiction and the more you need to cure your addiction the more you need to focus on righteousness because the poison and the Cure are the same thing and so again the only way out of the Abyss is through it you need to perfect your wisdom by recognizing not just figuratively but literally that The Cure is the poison and that Liberation is suffering and that wisdom is delusion because opposites are ultimately United in balance and they only exist separately in relation to each other to understand this is to deconstruct the separation between self and other being and a non-being because when one understands that there is no separation there is no longer something that can be poisoned and there is no longer something that needs to be cured there is no longer a reason or goal for one's addiction and finally one is able to give it up the path of righteousness is therefore an extremely difficult and dangerous challenge because you are entirely on your own you have already drunk the poison and there is no use in trying to avoid it you are totally ignoring the fact that the solution is behind you in Balance because you can also see the solution in front of you at the end of the path of righteousness it is simply that when you finally reach the end of the path the path vanishes there is no solution for the essence of righteousness is emptiness and emptiness is complimentarity and complimentarity is balance and balance is to have no problem that needs to be solved and to have no problem is Liberation what you perceived as the end of your mission was merely a window back to where we all begin you see most people are relatively happy to accept the world as it is without fully understanding it they do not completely accept it but they accept it enough to live a normal life to get a job and have a family and do all the normal things and they are therefore at least somewhat balanced but some of us are just not willing to not know that there's nothing to worry about and we have to go on this crazy adventure to definitively prove to ourselves what is ultimately so basic and common sensical that nobody knows that they know it that nobody knows that there is nothing to worry about that nobody knows that peace is the foundation of life most people just don't care that much but we do and so we take our caring to its extreme where we discover that we shouldn't care that much reality is not entirely serious and it's not entirely factious it's both and neither and the perfect balance between them it's all very amusing once you finally get it the mystical experience is an experience where you stare through the window and where you learn the solution but merely learning the solution is not enough because to learn the solution there must still be a problem and if there is still a problem you are still feeling yourself at a basic level to be something that can solve the problem and that takes a very big ego indeed my hands are raised it is therefore appropriate to refer to the state of perfect balance as the master skill of experience for when you reach this state you shall be able to engage with both righteousness and pleasure as much as you can without being addicted to either and this is peace nothing to solve no one to solve it so all of this was just a long way of telling you that I now understand that there is nothing left to gain from my addiction to righteousness which has ruled my life for the past 11 years so what do I do now I think I've given you quite enough answers if you'd care to sift through the videos posted on this channel perhaps one day the academics will also realize that I've even provided a resolution to all philosophical questions along the way yes this is very bold to say very egoic but it's true I can't undo what I've already done and at least it can serve to prevent anyone else from needing to do it which I think is a profound benefit to humankind I could keep on going explaining things in finer and finer detail or in increasingly general terms but for me to do this would be to continue to reinforce a state of disbalance within my myself and I don't really want to care that much about whether my mission to save the world succeeds or fails anymore though I admit this is still very hard for me to accept but I don't think it will succeed if I care too much because success would be the liberation of the world and that only comes from surrendering to balance I've done my bit now the next step is your hands I know what I need to do and that is to stop gazing at the truth I have talked enough talk I now need to walk the walk of course my purpose Remains the Same I will always to the best of my ability strive to help those who want to be helped out of suffering and delusion but in order to be able to do that I need to find peace for myself for a while in silence if I'm genuinely needed and wanted here I will return but it's goodbye for now
