## Transcript

Does para-philosophy agree with panpsychism? Where panpsychism is a position that mentality or at least some mind-like property is a fundamental feature of nature? I think panpsychism is an interesting position because it's really an incomplete idea. It needs further context in order to be understood. And I think there's a few ways to interpret panpsychism.

I think there is a standard way which would be as a form of property dualism. And in this sense, to say that mentality is a fundamental feature of reality, you need to qualify what that reality is consisting of. And I think normally panpsychists take or accept that reality is essentially constituted by matter or by some physical substance.

It's merely that this physical substance has a mind-like property necessitated into it. This would conflict with para-philosophy because that's ultimately a physicalistic view, which is a bias towards the objectivist perspective in para-philosophy. So panpsychist property dualism? No, that's not compatible with para-philosophy.

Another way that we can interpret panpsychism is as a form of neutral monism, where we take reality to be grounded in a single category of substance, but that substance is not material and it's not mental. In fact, mental and physical properties are emergent. They come later. I think that there's some value in the idea of neutral monism when it's qualified, but I also think that it's really incompatible with panpsychism because if you're accepting that the fundamental substance is neither mental nor material, then you're denying, but mentality is a fundamental feature of the fundamental substance.

Third, you can interpret panpsychism as a form of double aspect theory, or dual aspect theory, or dual aspect monism. And this is similar to neutral monism, but instead of denying that the fundamental substance has itself mentality and physicality, dual aspect theory accepts that these dual aspects, the mental and physical, are necessary expressions of this fundamental substance.

And I think in that sense, panpsychism can hold. This almost agrees with power philosophy, but in power philosophy, this would be biased towards the abjectiveist perspective, which seeks to look beyond the distinction between mind and matter at a more fundamental substance. And this kind of dual aspect monism, I think, the best example I can think of is Jung and Pauli's theory, but reality is grounded in the psychoid, which has a mental and material aspect.

But I think, again, this isn't entirely compatible with power philosophy because it's really an upward perspective on the distinction between mind and matter. In other words, mind and matter are grounded in something, something neutral in a sense that is completely disconnected with consciousness. It's a kind of like the simulation theory or the matrix, you can imagine.

And I think that this view disregards half of the story, which is that mind and matter have representation only within conscious experience. And if you're grounding reality in some sort of abjective substance, that substance really is, could be information entirely unconscious. So I think if dual aspect monism can be regarded as a tool true, it's only somewhat true in relation to its complementary viewpoint.

So if dual aspect monism is like an upward perspective of non duality where mind and matter are projected upwards out of chaos or nothingness, this is really like a complementary perspective to the downward perspective on non duality, which grounds the distinction between mind and matter not in something that's completely unconscious and outside experience, but the source or root of experience itself which is just conscious awareness.

And I think power philosophy aligns more closely with the latter kind, which would be the superjective perspective, which is ultimately a form of neutral monism in the sense that consciousness isn't mental or material, but it has the potential for both. So power philosophy would describe reality as a harmony between these two perspectives, the upward perspective of objective dual aspect theory and the downward perspective of superjective neutral monism.

And it's the harmony and interaction between nothing and everything or the deep unconscious and the light of consciousness that projects inwards and creates this dualistic experience that we have between mind and matter. But the downward perspective is a form of neutral monism, which is incompatible ultimately with panpsychism.

So I think the answer to the question basically is panpsychism is not necessary in power philosophy. It's a concept that is useful to provide an answer to a problem that doesn't actually exist. That problem is how does mentality arise and a physical universe? And if we don't accept that the universe is fundamentally physical, then the problem fades away quite easily.

And there was a second part to this question, which was, are you a monist or a dualist? And I think I've kind of answered that already. So power philosophy really is operating beyond these distinctions from the objectivist perspective. We have dual aspect theory. From the superjectivist perspective, we have neutral monism or even just standard non-dualism or non-duality.

But from the phenomenal perspective, which is in a sense, just as fundamental as the other perspectives, we have a real dualism, a substance dualism. So I think the best answer to the question, am I a monist or a dualist, is that power philosophy could be described as a kind of non-dualistic dualism. In a sense that non-duality, consciousness and duality, the distinction between mind and matter are complementary to each other and reciprocal.

They both depend on each other. Consciousness emerges out of the mind-matter distinction, but mind and matter are contained within consciousness. It's this self-referential thing that I'm sure you'll be familiar with if you listen to any of my work by this point. If you have any other questions about power philosophy or want my opinion on some other philosophical idea, please let me know in the comments below.

If you disagree with anything I've said, I invite your challenge, I'm always looking to expand my understanding.
