## Transcript

welcome back to this journey through the countryside of the south of England I've just left bath heading towards London and I came across a sign to a village named box I thought this was an interesting name for a village so I decided to make a quick stop as I was driving in I had to go over an interesting looking Bridge so I wanted to go and check it out the box tunnel is a Subterranean Marvel who through the Limestone under the agis of the illustrious engineer isombard Kingdom Brunell completed in the year 1841 this remarkable feat of Victorian Ingenuity also Harbors an enigmatic Legend with its precise alignment and exacting construction the tunnel is a conduit of not merely trains but also Celestial Luminosity the tunnel is so meticulously oriented that on brunell's birthday April 9th the rising sun projects its Radiance in an unbroken line through the aperture of the tunnel's considerable length as I was about to walk away a train went through the tunnel so I set up my camera to try and catch the next one I ended up waiting for like 20 minutes a woman stopped and asked me if a steam train was expected I said I have no idea I'm just hoping for a normal train and she said oh you're not a train spotter then I laughed and said I wasn't we spoke briefly about what I was doing in a random Town filming a tunnel and she informed me that Thomas the Tank Engine was created in a house nearby there are ultimately only two states a human being can exist in ignorance or understanding belief or knowledge there are a million ways to exist in a state of ignorance but there is just one way to exist in a state of understanding all beliefs are ignorant it does not matter whether your belief is rational and Justified because understanding does not come from belief it only comes from knowledge and it is possible to understand the nature of Human Experience for to know is simply to have moved beyond the state of belief when all beliefs are dissolved from your mind then you will begin to see that knowledge is what remains it was there before all your beliefs and you covered it up so again there are only two states we can exist in we can direct our attention towards ideas and theories which we agree or disagree with and thus we build up and live within a mental image of the world or we cannot do this we can reject all mental images and see the world as it is without the interference of labels the next Village I pass through is called Lok I'm aware that there is an Abbey in this Village that is of particular importance to fans of a certain franchise of modest popularity I walk to the entrance of the Abbey but they were charging like £17 or something for entry nevertheless I found a path that led around the back of the Abbey filled with sheep I noticed that the back door was open and for a moment I considered hopping the fence to film inside quickly 10 years ago I probably would have but I decided against it this time anyway this is what the inside looks like do you recognize it [Applause] I next stopped in a town called Cal and I noticed that there were several signs advertising great scientific discoveries that had been discovered in this town including that of oxygen and photosynthesis the claim is that c is the town of Discovery but I'll be honest I wasn't much of a fan of the Town itself I did find this statue of a couple piglets though which which I found a little interesting the unassuming town of Cal in Wiltshire hides a history that defies the town's modest exterior once a veritable epicenter of the wool trade this town also achieved a distinction in the annals of gastronomic history for it is here that the process of curing bacon a culinary development of profound and far reaching import was discovered enter Dr William Gilbert an enterprising local from the 18th century whose Ingenuity illuminated the process by which ordinary pork could be transmogrified into that most celebrated of cured meats the discovery that salt when applied with precise methodology could not only preserve but enhance the flavor of pork was a culinary revelation the next Village I drove through was aere and this is actually the site of the largest megalithic stone circle in the world there's actually many Stone circles here they were scattered in fields in almost every direction I decided not to stop however as there were loads of tourists and I was planning to visit the more famous cousin Stone Henge at the end of my trip for the summer solstice anyway they're just stones when a person feels the peaceful state of no longer believing that their ideas can be discriminately true a fundamental shift occurs one begins to realize that the idea that we must believe and reason our way towards the truth along with all the goals and intentions we have to this end was simply foolishness trying always to experience more Comfort or trying to build a worldview that makes us feel like we have things figured out is precisely what prevents us from seeing the beauty and sufficiency of experience in the absence of any attempt to limit and Define it in any particular way it is the Folly of the pessimists of the hedonists and critically of the philosophers but there is also danger in this realization for if the State of non-belief overshadows the State of belief then it may be seen as somehow better than belief and is different from belief thus The Duality emerges between ignorance and understanding and if one devotes themselves to understanding as opposed to ignorance well now they are merely believing in disbelief and they have fallen for the ultimate trap of life I next arrived in a town called malur and I was so tired at this point that I had to have a quick nap in a car park I then went for a fairly long walk around the town passing the very fancy Public School malur College in the middle of which there was a rather mysterious and large Hill actually it was a barrow I tried to get a shot of it but there wasn't really a good angle after this I walked through the High Street this quaint Market Town stands out for one singularly wide thoroughfare it's High Street a broad expanse that stretches nearly as far as the imagination might wander and in these bounds lies a legend of mythical proportions a taale that has been spun into the town's very fabric the legend posits the the broad High Street was the unintended creation of none other than a giant named Merlin this Merlin not to be conflated with the Arthurian sorcerer was a Colossus reputed to have roamed the ancient Countryside with casual a Plumb in an episode of Titanic oish Merlin is said to have dropped a boulder of truly Majestic proportions the ensuing impact so the legend SE as was such that it gouged an Avenue into the Earth that would later evolve into the town's own High Street Legend has it that the town's name marbor has its eological roots embedded in this peculiar Fable derived as it were from Merlin's Barrow indeed the term Barrow refers to a burial mound and so Merlin's Barrow which dates back 3,500 years is apparently where our Merlin lies at rest I make it back to my car and head towards the market town of Newbury naturally I headed straight to weather spoons to have dinner I go for a short walk and then go back to my car at this point I'd started to feel a slight sensation of dread I contemplate whether I'm wasting my time by doing this trip and I have doubts about ever achieving my goals in life it took me world to find an appropriate place to sleep but eventually I did I really must have been exhausted the previous day cuz I slept for 10 hours but I was feeling rejuvenated now and the dread and doubt from the previous day slowly subside as I walk around this nearby Reservoir after walking around the reservoir I head off towards reading I reached reading and walk into the town there was a really nice smell in the air like a mixture of Middle Eastern cuisine and perfume naturally it was time for a couple Gregs sausage rolls followed by weather spoons again as I needed to free up some storage space on my phone I had a quest to complete now to find a particular building that like the glastenbury thorn from the first episode May or may not actually exist among the many compelling Tales one could tell about reading there is one chapter that concerns the town's historical association with none other than the venerable biscuit Hunley and Palmers established in the year 1822 burgeoned into one of the largest biskuit manufacturers the world has ever seen so pervasive was its influence that it earn reading the affectionate nickname of biscuit Town reading's Football team were also known as the biscuit men and the company provided free biscuits for all first class rail Travelers coming home from London the company was responsible for transforming what was once a humble Homespun treat into a globally recognized commercial product by the early 20th century Huntley and Palmers had become the Coca-Cola of the United Kingdom Kingdom their biscuits being sold in 172 countries around the world I found this apartment building that is clearly related to Huntley and Palmer but I don't think this is one of the original buildings if there are any left I eventually found this building here and I do believe that this is the only remaining building of the famed Biscuit Company I'm now driving into slau which was a somewhat painful experience here someone almost drove into me cuz he was looking at his phone slow is a local that has garnered the attention of poets television producers and critics alike a veritable case study in the sociocultural metamorphosis of post industrial br the town's most prominent literary Accolade if one may call it such comes from the notable poet John bimman whose poem slow commences with the evocative imperative come friendly bombs and fall on slow it isn't fit for humans now Beyond this slow has earned the indelible place in contemporary media through its role as the setting for the original UK version of of the television series the office at this point I haven't showered in a few days so I found a gym where I could reset I had to somewhat black my way in CU I don't think this particular gym was technically covered on my membership by the receptionist didn't give me much hassle about it I just checked when I was outside it's exactly the same as this one so it should be included you may not recognize this unassuming premere in building but this is a sight of considerable note to me in fact one of the reasons I was interested in stopping in slow was because this was the location of a TV sitcom that I was very fond of growing up Ricky ja's the office and this is where it was set only of course the original building was demolished about 10 years ago and replaced with this lovely structure here after this I go to Spoons to do a bit more work and then I started driving towards London I didn't get any footage of this because London has recently installed a lower missions Zone extending into its outskirts and since I'm driving an 18-year-old car I can't go into it without paying a charge which I didn't want to do so I had to be careful to skirt around the edge of the zone I had a pretty good night's sleep again and the next morning I head towards London I've actually parked in this location because I had the idea that I might see how far I can get in walking into or even through London in a completely straight line I haven't put much thought into this so I'm almost certainly going to fail I just wanted to see how far I could get and thus I'm heading to the start of what was once called Roman Watling Street which as the name suggests was originally a Roman Road actually the road is much older than the Romans and has been a trackway of some kind since very ancient times but in London the current road extends for 10 miles in an almost perfectly straight line and I shall be walking all of it the Trap of believing in disbelief is a trap that I myself have been stuck in for many years and I don't know whether whether this makes it better or worse but I have been aware of this I have been aware that what I have been doing in life does not lead towards peace I just didn't care about peace I was enraptured by what I have previously referred to as the feeling of righteousness by the notion that while what one is focused on may not be beneficial for oneself it is nevertheless beneficial for the World At Large and this feeling that one is doing something important and valuable for humankind is a much more powerful feeling than the feeling that one is doing something that is beneficial for oneself alone than pleasure both righteousness and pleasure can make us feel good but both of them conceal an Insidious suffering a focus on Pleasure leads us to care most about ourselves so we suffer morally while a focus F us on righteousness leads us to care most about the world and so we suffer physically both of these forms of suffering are largely unconscious we become uninterested in and detached from morality or immorality in one case and happiness or sadness in the other we are ignorant that we are not living morally or we are ignorant that we are not living happily because we cannot truly care about only ourselves or the world it is merely that we have repressed one half of ourselves to the unconscious and so often when we think we have broken free from belief and our abiding in understanding we have not the feeling of righteousness is an attachment to the idea of Enlightenment or Liberation and so long as we remain attached to this idea we can only learn about it and cannot embody it the key to achieving peace in one's life and genuine understanding of the nature of experience is to surrender your understanding of understanding and ignorance itself to surrender the understanding I have described in this video this is something I have not yet learned how to do for the last day or so I've had a slight pain in my left Achilles tendon which was odd because I've never had that before and it's not entirely uncommon for me to go on long walks I've been able to ignore it so far but today it was honestly so damn painful that I had to adopt a strange walking technique of rotating my foot outwards so that the tendon was in a more fixed position I was really enjoying the walk though and I promise I'm not just whining it really was becoming Agony and I had about 14 mil to walk that day what's going on here is that this kid tries to Nutmeg me which is when you pass a ball through someone's legs of course I'm far too observant to fall for that trick so I intercept the ball roll it onto my foot and attempt to do an around the world and fortunately my football skills weren't quite up to scratch that day so I didn't land it and almost kicked the ball into the [Applause] road very skillful almost something I was incredibly excited to show you on this journey was London's marble triumphal art and here it is it looks a little more flat than I remember it here's something you probably didn't expect if you're familiar with this channel this is Park Lane a very fancy Street near Mayfair and back before I had my first mystical experience that led to my rejection of all things material I used to work on this street just to the left here used to be a famous nightclub called whiskey Mist where I worked as a table host which was basically just a glorified promoter it is strange to think how I went from Total extrovert working here to the absolute extremes of introversion in less than a year while I don't think I'll be returning to anything remotely like this anytime soon it probably is time to to return back to a slightly more balanced position at this point there really was no keeping on a straight line cuz right in front of me is the wall to Buckingham Palace garden and if I tried to find a way through there I would most likely be shot I didn't bother going past the palace cuz I'm too cool and it was getting late I had to meet a friend I get to Victoria and take the train to my friend's place and that is where our journey ends for today [Music]
