## Transcript

By the end of this video, you will understand something that is so obvious that you will likely feel that you have known it forever. And yet, in spite of its immense importance, words have never been put to this knowledge in its entirety, it has not been discussed, and therefore also its true value has remained unknown.

And so, if you are a budding philosopher, or even just a deep thinker, there is opportunity here for new breakthroughs, and for great progress, and I encourage you to participate in this new movement. In any intellectual consideration, there are two factors that influence the beliefs and ideas we arrive at.

The degree to which we are influenced by these factors, and the degree to which we are able to perceive the reality in systems expressing them, determines the beliefs we hold in regard to matters of philosophy. The first of these factors is determinateness, the capacity of being determined, limited, or otherwise clearly defined.

Systems expressing determinateness tend to be concrete, fragmentalistic, and overt. Indeed, the capacity of being measured is a qualifying mark of concreteness, for it is this same capacity that allows physical phenomena to impart change on the world. The second factor is immutability, the incapacity for change.

Systems expressing immutability tend to be abstract, holistic, and covert. Abstract entities are favoured not because they can be empirically determined, but because they are consistent elements of our experience. A quality like redness is impervious to change, and this permanence and invariability is the only way we can identify the relation between particular red things.

Determinateness and immutability fit the roles of belief satisfying properties, because all the objects of experience can be described by one or the other. That is clearly definable is subject to change, and what is unchanging lacks specific characteristics. There is a way of looking at both of these properties and finding in them value and credibility as the basis of our beliefs.

It is merely that individuals are better or worse at grasping the reality expressed by either, leading us naturally into biased perspectives of our world. Indeed, when we examine the history of philosophical discourse, we find that the division between certain subjectivists and objectivist approaches to respective problems lies on the distinction between our adherence to determinateness and immutability respectively.

Allow me to explain. In the study of knowledge, determinateness manifests as a posteriori or experiential knowledge, while immutability manifests as analytic or logical knowledge. That is, the a posteriori is determinate, because it refers to things that are only knowable through external determination, like all swans are white.

The analytic is immutable, because it refers to things that are only knowable, and so far as they are necessarily entailed by the definition of a concept to topologies, like all bachelor's are unmarried. In the study of being, determinateness manifests as concreteness, while immutability manifests as universality.

That is, concrete objects are determinate in so far as they are measurable and corporeal, like a table. Examples are immutable, because they are permanent, like the quality redness. In the study of value, determinateness manifests as subjectivity, while immutability manifests as absoluteness. Subjective value is determinate, because it is grounded in determinable facts about people in attitude and opinion.

Absolute value is immutable, and so far as the same rule applies universally throughout any context. And finally, in politics and the study of right, determinateness manifests as liberty and libertarianism, while immutability manifests as equality and collectivism. That is, liberty and libertarianism are determinate in their emphasis on the freedom of individuals to pursue and determine their own ideals and goals.

Equality and collectivism are immutable in their emphasis on the uniformity of individuals in a society, such as in the equality of our shared humanity. An analysis of the ways in which we can interpret basic philosophical notions reveals that there is a uniform structure underlying our theories, which we can call the dialectical matrix.

This structure is constructed from two dichotomies related to how we form beliefs, determinateness versus indeterminateness, and immutability versus mutability. Those committed to determinateness are naturally drawn to positions like empiricism, materialism or moral relativism, while those who are more taken by immutability may have an easier time justifying positions like rationalism, idealism, and moral objectivism.

This structure provides the methodological foundation of a new science of philosophy referred to as para-philosophy. Unlike traditional philosophy which seeks true or good ideas, para-philosophy is interested in the source of those ideas. It is indifferent to the traditional assumption that there is a single theory that answers every philosophical question.

It is concerned merely with that which underlies our ability to reason such theories, with our basic capacity to envision something as being true, and the structure through which this capacity is translated into theory. It matters not whether our inquiry concerns knowledge or being or virtue, all positive philosophical notions emerge from this uniform structure, and so the content of all topics is correlated, with each concept from one topic reflecting those from others.

Inevitably then, we must ask, what is the source of this structure? If our intellect and experience is necessarily conditioned by this structure, then philosophical knowledge shall elude us, but if that which binds us is the world itself, then we should know that all views are true, and that each aspect is a part of an underlying whole.

Indeed, the structure extends into our psychology. Determinateness relies on our capacity for extraversion, to perceive the determinable objects of our external environment. Immutability relies on our capacity for feeling, to perceive the immutable qualities internal to our experience. The pattern continues when we consider our physiology, with the sympathetic nervous system, giving us the ability to interact with the outside world, and with the right hemisphere of the brain, allowing us to recognise the global and general features of stimuli.

The structure penetrates right to the core of our being, down past the distinction between the mind and brain, but it also penetrates to the core of our understanding of truth. Determinateness guides us towards the verification of what is true, and is logically related to the law of non-contradiction.

While immutability guides us towards the falsification of what is false, and is related to the law of excluded middle. I'll save you an explanation of this particular point in this video, as it relies on formal logic, but suffice it to say that even the concept of truth itself is bound by this structure, and so the structure does not appear to be a mere artifact of the way our minds work.

It appears to reflect something much deeper. If you decide to continue this exploration which you have already begun, you will see that para-philosophy is able to provide an explanation for the appearance of duality in the world as the relativization of the innately paradoxical core of experience. And just as a wave has both a crest and a trough, all form has that which is revealed, and that which is hidden.

On one side we have the positive object, and on the other, the negative subject. Which has form only insofar as the other completes them. The object complements the subject. The subject complements the object, but only together is either of them whole. The necessary correspondence and parallelism between the mental and material provides us with an incredibly powerful tool for describing previously inaccessible aspects of reality.

Some patterns of experience may be more comprehensible as determinate properties of physics and sensation, while others may be more accessible as immutable properties of psychology and feeling. There may thus be aspects of both that can only be identified via their correspondence with their other. We can understand physics through psychology and psychology through physics, opening the doors to rich new fields of interdisciplinary and collaborative arts that will break down the walls of fragmentalism and isolationism that have been built by the spirit of our time.

Paraphalosophy could provide great insights in medicine, particularly for the treatment of chronic conditions with both affective and somatic components. Beyond this, it may provide a path to greater levels of consciousness in already healthful subjects. Furthermore, Paraphalosophy provides a framework for the psychophysical parallelism espoused by figures such as Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz, and it also explains the mechanism of the synchronicity described by Carl Jung and Wolfgang Pauli.

Understanding the correlation between the physical and the psychic can also guide us towards a proper interpretation of phenomena described by quantum physics, such as the collapse of the wave function and quantum entanglement. Insofar as Paraphalosophy describes a complementary relationship between the physical mechanisms of cellular processes and the goal-oriented functions of organisms at large, it also hints at a hidden aspect of evolution, one which reconciles the seeming incompatibility between nature and nurture with a miraculous correspondence between determinism and free will.

And the consequences of establishing a practical duality that extends into ethical and civil life has profound implications for society, economics and politics. The goal would be to achieve a harmonious balance between the collectivist and libertarian aspects of society by means of the dualisation of governance, regulation and power.

Humanity slowly walks the path towards the eventual unification of the opposites of our world. There is much to say in further videos about the many implications and possibilities of Paraphalosophy, assuming of course that I'm not in fact mistaken, but what I can say for sure is that there are far too many implications and possibilities for myself alone to ever discover and understand.

And so this is a first calling to join in on this cause and take part in what might just be the next great advancement in human understanding.
