## Transcript

Phenomenal Reality is the process of reality learning what itself is, and self-knowledge is self-creation. Ultimate reality is emptiness, for it contains nothing predetermined, and it is fullness, for it is the capacity to determine anything. Without the passage of time, reality comes to understand itself, and thus it becomes more real, for again, knowledge and creation are one.

And since reality is nothing but the potential for everything, its essence is the knowledge of its own lack of a predetermined essence. It is the knowledge that there is nothing fundamentally to know, apart from the ability to know it. For the absence of away things must be is pure freedom, and freedom is the womb of creation.

The fundamental nature of reality is a paradox. It is precisely because it is not, because there is nothing stopping it from being. The nature of the self is freedom, and to completely know the self is to not know the self. As a wise man once said, all that I know is that I know nothing. The mystery of reality is not merely how consciousness understands the paradox of being, but how it understands how it understands.

Understanding is natural, we all understand that we are conscious, but we do not understand how we understand, for we know nothing other than being conscious. The only way to understand how we understand is to forget that we understand, so that we may learn it again. The mystery emerges because this understanding concerns a paradox, and a paradox cannot be broken into parts that can be learnt piece by piece.

We might learn on one hand why a paradox is true, but this ignores why it is false. We might learn why it is false, but this ignores why it is true. The paradox is what it is not, and so the only way to learn about the paradox which is ourselves is to learn about each of its aspects at the same time, but in total separation.

This is thus the creation of duality in experience. The emergence and evolution of duality is that necessary process by which reality comes to understand itself. As reality gains self-knowledge, the cyclical and physical domains of experience come into being. At heart they are united, but to understand why they are united they must first be brought apart.

At the beginning stages of evolution, the distinction between them is minimal, and as experience gains and intellectual understanding internally, there is an equal and compensatory representation externally. Since this is a process of learning, it is a rational process that is structured in accordance with patterns that facilitate learning.

The laws of physics, and indeed the laws of mind, are consequences of the rational nature of the learning process, and so the outside world naturally appears to us as a closed deterministic system, indeed it is a closed system. No subjective thought or individual will can do anything to affect the physical world, but the physical world is necessarily correlated with the realm of mind, so it is just as if thoughts affect things, and we should live as if they do.

Physics is not a counterpoint to this idea. This is in no way antagonistic to science. Physics is an absolute necessity, for physics is the way that reality structures itself to enable its own understanding. The development of self-knowledge manifests as the increase of the intelligence of life, which is in turn an increase in our ability to perceive and conceive the reality of the outside world, which is in turn an increase in the reality of that world.

Thus it is quite natural that as we become more sophisticated we eventually align ourselves with a materialist understanding of nature. It's not that this understanding is ultimately true, but that the ability to imagine that it is true is a stage through which the evolution of all life must pass. We often take for granted that in the Western world at least the birth of wisdom occurred with the ancient Greeks.

This is a mistake. The recognition of ourselves as separate from the world and the increase in our intelligence is that which generates our need to know, but in wisdom there is no need to know. Before long forgotten archaic past, before the calculated philosophy of the ancient Greeks, where mythologies and fairy tales reigned supreme held far more wisdom than our age of reason, the history of philosophy is the fading of wisdom.

For while philosophy merely desires for wisdom, true wisdom must surrender its attachment to itself. You see, wisdom is grounded in a unity between knowing and not knowing, between fact and fiction, discovery and creation. Wisdom is to be united with the self, and the self is a coincidence of opposites.

Our mythological and allegorical past reflects the earlier contraction of duality in our experience, where we were closer to the source of being. And as the intellect so plants our instinctual wisdom, we forget the meaning buried in mythology's past, but we must not judge the ego and the microscope and the telescope for science and materialism are necessary tools of our remembering.

It is the rigor and level-headedness of science that facilitates the building of a new kind of wisdom which shall one day guide us back home. We need uncertainty to fuel the desire for progress, and we need progress in order to embrace uncertainty. The path to self-knowledge must first lead away from the self, for it is in this separation that the ability for rational thought evolves.

One day we shall, on a collective level, be capable of enough self-reference to recognise the destination as back where evolution began, where subject and object were not yet divorced. But while our departure from wisdom was unconscious and natural, our return towards it shall be conscious and deliberate.

We shall surrender the ego willingly, and when that happens we shall stop analysing the world and breaking it into ever smaller parts, and we shall synthesise and reintegrate into the whole. We shall always be driven by progress, but progress in dissecting the world and mastering the world is only one face of progress.

The other face is the face of wisdom, and while mastery facilitates both in the beginning a tipping point will come, where more separation serves only to hinder our journey to self-knowledge. I think the biggest mistake in practically all disciplines, philosophy, science, religion, even esotericism, is to fail to recognise that reality is experience, and experience is an action.

Which is something the self is actively doing. All actions can be performed better or worse, and so experiencing is a skill. The world around us evolves purely because we are gaining skill in doing experience. Yet, at the same time, the world around us evolves in accordance with natural laws of physics.

So this is how perfect reality is. The logic of physics is the same logic as that of experience. Every aspect is in harmonious symphony with the whole. I'll try to state this as plainly as I can. Having reality, or being real, is a skill. And as we become better at having reality, or being real, we gain more reality, and we become more real.

Absolute self-knowledge is the state of having masters, the skill, of experiencing, and of realness. And we are only fully real when we have complete self-knowledge. Power philosophy, and the state of being real, is a celebration. It is absolute optimism. Because we know that we are all saved. Because we must become fully real.

Because if the self never became fully real, there would be no self to even begin to learn that it is fully real when the cycle starts over again. We are creating ourselves. And the thing that is creating is the very same thing that is being created. We are merely looking at the self from the relative, temporal, and incomplete perspective of individuality.

The underlying nature of the world is the creation of the world. And there is only a beginning when there is already an end.
