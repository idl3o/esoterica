## Transcript

In the early 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes presented the world with his influential theory of substance dualism. This is the idea that mind and matter are separate substances that interact with each other within the human brain. At the time, natural philosophy was dominated by Christianity, and Descartes' ideas would allow us to disconnect the realm of matter from that of the divine and thus establish an independent physical science.

However, the problem of interaction between the two worlds was a great one, for it appeared that any non-physical cause of a physical event would constitute a break in the causal chain, and thus a violation of natural law. And so, following Descartes, a number of theories emerged that replaced his principle of interaction with one of parallelism, whereby mental and physical events correspond without any causality between them.

We find versions of this idea in a number of prominent 17th century philosophers, such as Baruch Spinoza, Nicholas Malbranche and Gottfried Leibniz. Well, psychophysical parallelism resolves the major problem with Cartesian dualism. It does not, by itself, explain how this correlation is established. If mind and matter are separate substances, then it seems as though they must operate independently.

Nicholas Malbranche addressed this problem by asserting that it is Gott who causes all events. He causes a person to move their hand in the physical world, and he causes them to have the thought to move their hand in the mental world. This theory wasn't all too satisfying, however, for it deconstructs Descartes' foundation for an independent physical science.

That is because if everything is caused by gods, then mental events don't have mental causes, and physical events don't have physical causes. Thus enter Baruch Spinoza, who replace Descartes' substance dualism with a dual aspect monism. This is the idea that there is ultimately just one kind of stuff, God or nature, but that this substance has two corresponding aspects, or attributes.

Since mind and matter are merely appearances of a more fundamental neutral thing, God or nature, they are independent, yet inseparable, like two sides of a single coin. Following Spinoza, Leibniz believed that the universe was created in accordance with a pre-established harmony, whereby everything that happens follows a predetermined path.

The domains of mind and matter are like two synchronized clocks, neither one influences the other, but they nevertheless always tell the same time. A hundred years later Arthur Schopenhauer entered the discussion, claiming that what we call chance is merely the simultaneous occurrence of predetermined events.

These events are ultimately caused by a transcendental will, which links causally disconnected things in such a way that they come together at the right time, resolving the apparent conflict between the laws of nature and the freedom of the will. Finally, in the early 20th century, psychologists Carl Jung and physicist Wolfgang Pauli developed a theory centered around a particular effect of psychophysical parallelism, which they called synchronicity.

Synchronicity is the perception of a correlation between subjective and objective occurrences. These occurrences are a causal, but the sense of meaning betrayed by synchronicities within our lives, suggested to Pauli and Jung that they are not mere coincidences, but rather pointed towards a common ground state of reality referred to by them as the psychoid Unus Mundus or One World.

Note that synchronicity is explicitly not the idea that unrelated events have any kind of occult causal connection, but rather that there is some kind of meaningful psychological connection between events that are genuinely independent. Pauli went so far as to take synchronicity to be the psychical equivalent of a phenomenon found in modern physics called quantum entanglement.

He posited that the two together provide a model for the relationship between mind and matter, in the framework of a dual aspect monism, much like Spinoza. According to this idea, the wave view of matter would correspond to the unconscious mind, both of which are united in the psychoid or objective realm whose nature is unmanifest potential or perhaps even mathematical.

Subjective conscious reflection serves as that psychological process which actualises makes conscious the potentialities of unconscious contents. And objective measurement is the corresponding physical process which actualises makes material the potentialities of unobserved quantum. It is in this way that synchronicity and entanglement are artifacts of a prior unobserved unity.

Now, if we could establish that there is a parallelism between our mental and material worlds, then we would have established a truly revolutionary tool for describing elements of the world that are otherwise out of reach. Not all aspects of the physical world may be easily accessible by science, yet those things will have a psychical correlate which may be easily accessible by psychology.

Once we elucidate the full system of correspondences, we shall then be able to understand physics through psychology and psychology through physics opening the doors to rich new fields of interdisciplinary sciences. This inquiry would begin at the level of the human organism with the mind-body connection and the breakthroughs in medicine encoded into this connection and emanate beyond it.

Eventually identifying correlates for both the stars and planets beyond us and for molecules and atoms within us. This is the only true key to the marriage of science and spirituality. It would be the stars of a modern scientific mythology, but in the ancients, anthropomorphised, the inert material world.

Indeed, there is esoteric significance to psychophysical parallelism beyond the overtly scientific. Karl Jung is noted for his belief that the historical discipline of alchemy was in fact an effort to harness the connection between chemical and psychical processes of transmutation. It was not simply states of matter and metals, according to Jung, to the alchemists sought to transform, but also their own states of mind.

We would birth a new dimension of language, one with which the level-headedness of science may commune with those who profess the existence of magic and fate and laws of attraction. We could maintain that there is no causality involved in these things, that the integrity of science is maintained, while acknowledging that the meaningful coincidences involved in such beliefs are legitimate, and that there is indeed something more going on than chance alone.

Previously, we discussed what could be called the third choice within philosophical ideology. The middle way between subjectivist idealism and objectivist materialism, this perspective the abjectivist perspective reflects a neutral ground beneath the subject and object, as expressed by Jung and Pauli's psychoid monism.

In para-philosophy, we understand that all moderate philosophical positions are versions of abjectivism in varying degrees, and in the social sphere neutral and moderate positions such as can be found in liberal democracy or in conservatism are generally preferable to discriminatory extremism, such as anarcho-capitalism or authoritarian socialism.

But now, we must make a crucial distinction between pure abjectivism, which grounds reality in neutrality, such that mind and matter are mere illusions of the same, and between the dual aspect monism of para-philosophy, which recognizes that mind and matter are necessary expressions and modalities of the neutral, and indeed that the neutral abjectiv depends on duality, having no independent existence.

We arrived at this conclusion in the previous video, which I would recommend you are viewing following this one, but in essence the abjectiv can be thought of as a kind of mathematical structure which describes precisely the equal but opposite and interlocking shapes of mind and matter. It is, in a sense, the source code of reality and the substrate of parallelism synchronicity, and perhaps also entanglement.

Accordingly, we can begin to understand how moderateism is the trap of abjectivism, for it is an attempt to establish neutrality in the absence of duality, which is our greatest delusion and a rejection of reality in favour of the transcendent. If the abjectiv is necessarily expressed through the modality of duality, then providing a monistic and moderate theory of this very real duality, is merely an attempt to reduce the subject and the object to some ethereal something which is totally alien to both logic and experience as epitomised by Immanuel Kant's transcendentalist theory of the Numenon.

Such must be a vacuous and lifeless theory which in society leads only towards an absence of both equality and liberty. A repeat my conclusion from the first part of this series, the more moderate the idea, the less true it is, and the more extreme the truer. We admit both extremes of the spectrum into our theory and not just one.

The process by which duality arises as our world has now been articulated by para-philosophy. Just as a straight line can be agitated to produce a wave with a crest and a trough, the underlying matrix of potential can be agitated to give rise to the positive object and the negative subject. The underlying system is dormant and neutral, it is not a thing in itself.

To generate the palpable reality we perceive or projectively, it must be compensated by its converse, by the visceral ideality we reflect on subjectively. United they are nothing, but separated they are something. However, something does not simply spring up out of nothing, while the relative existence of mind and matter is in a sense raised up from the non-existent.

In another sense, it is projected outwards from that which exists absolutely, while the objective is neither subjective nor objective, the superjective, which is conscious awareness and the self is both. It is through an act of sacrifice and of forgetting that the self lends its own reality to the nothing, to birth, the compensatory realms of relativity, mind and matter.

The dialectical matrix is the result of a scientific process. It is both empirical, logical and intuitive. Paraphalosophy is the self creation of the dialectical matrix, or to put this more simply, Paraphalosophy is the dialectical matrix when we take this structure as objectively real, indeed, as the shape that reality is growing into, and if this structure is reality, then the quadrants of the structure are the quadrants of reality.

In this way, different philosophical theories are true in regard to their respective quadrants. Now, let us keep in mind this idea of psychophysical parallelism, whereby everything present in the objective world is correlated with something subjective and vice versa. The objective aspect is quantitative and reductive.

It is related to verificationism and positivism, which tells us what is true but not what is false. It is the objectivist has ample reasons to believe in his position, but he must not overstep its bounds and attempt to establish its supremacy. He has no grounds to tell his opponents that they are wrong.

The subjective aspect is qualitative and holistic. It is related to falsificationism and negativism, which tells us what is false but not what is true. It is the subjectivist struggles to make definitive assertions, a fact that objectivists often employ to disparage idealism as just a bunch of woo. But through the comprehensive use of negation, it is able to illuminate rich and powerful structures built purely of negative facts.

Indeed, the entirety of language, symbolism and all meaning-making is founded on negation. And so, just as words and signs are devoid of positive properties, being defined solely by the fact that they do not mean what other words and signs mean, the abstract concept itself, the universal, is also a negative existent.

Ideas and qualities are negatively correlated with the physical things they describe, and this is in such a way that the union of a positive physical thing and all the negative, ideal qualities adhered to it bring us back to baseline and back to neutrality. They are like two identical shapes, one convex and the other concave.

Equality is therefore a literal absence, a subtraction from neutrality, for to extract the positive object from neutral potential, everything that remains must now become negative, something the object is not, and these non-beings form the foundation for qualities. The redness of an apple is the superposition of everything that is not red and not an apple.

The sharpness of a knife is the superposition of everything that is not sharp and not a knife. And I note that this implies that the key to understanding quantum mechanics is in fact to be found in psychology rather than solely in physics. So, with this idea, we can understand psychology and physics, and the relation between them is our understanding of meta-physics.

What else do you want? Well, how about a science of ethics? The objective world validates moral-subjective relativism, which reflecting the positive aspect dictates what may be considered right and just. The subjective world validates moral-objective absolutism, which reflecting the negative aspect dictates what is wrong and unjust.

Considered together, nothing is objectively good or beautiful, and so anything can be considered good or beautiful, so long as it is not objectively bad or ugly, for the not wrong is defined in terms of the wrong. Naturally, then, we find that this combination of objectivism and relativism leads to an ethical theory which, normatively, coincides with the objectivist position of value pluralism.

For this is the consequence of a pre-established harmony. And how about some more? We can infer from para-philosophy what is the structure of the ideal political system for any point in time, and I have confidence that this will prove to be an incredibly important aspect of para-philosophy. Now, of course, any practicable political theory requires extreme deliberation, and I am by no means a political theorist.

In fact, this is the implication of para-philosophy I am personally excited about the least, because I'm just not naturally that into politics. In the following video, therefore, I present not what I want for the world, nor what I believe is possible, but what must be the case, according to para-philosophy, to allow mankind to reach the next stage in his social and technological evolution?
