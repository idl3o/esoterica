## Transcript

Hello, and welcome back–or just welcome, if you’ve only just become lucky enough to find your way here. In the previous 3 videos, we’ve been examining the concepts of Brahman and emptiness/sunyata as found in Vedanta and Buddhism respectively, and now we’re moving back to the West, to consider the very interesting connection between Immanuel Kant’s critical philosophy and Nagarjuna’s middle way philosophy.

In this video, we shall begin to see how the self-aware critique of our biases and one-sided perspectives is the ground upon which intuitive insight into the nature of reality begins to germinate. Kant and Nagarjuna make for a very interesting comparison in this regard because both accept the conventional, empirical reality of things, while also acknowledging their transcendental or ultimate unreality.

Kant was of course most interested in providing a solid foundation for science, while Nagarjuna was clearing the space for spiritual insight, but both achieve their goal by resolving the conflict of opposites–between rationalism and empiricism for Kant, and between essentialism and nihilism for Nagarjuna.

I hope your enjoy the video. In both Kant's and Nagarjuna's systems, critique is the method by which we may transcend duality by exposing how the categories that generate the dialectic of opposites are rooted in the subjective structures of thought. Critical philosophy, as defined by Kant, is the self-examination of reason with the aim of exposing its inherent limitations, and thus defining the possibilities of knowledge itself.

Nagarjuna’s dialectical prasangika method is similarly a self-examination of reason, with the aim of exposing the inherent contradictions within commonly held beliefs, and the construction of dualities which do not really exist. In this way, critique, and dialectic, can be thought of as the paraphilosophical awareness of duality as the essential mode of human comprehension, which is of course also what we are doing with syntheorology and the dialectical matrix.

For Kant, the thing-in-itself—the noumenon—is beyond rational thought. For Nagarjuna, it is emptiness—sunyata—which is beyond rational thought. And both noumena and emptiness, representing the limit of rational thought, are approached via negativa. Kant describes noumena as the boundary of our conceptual knowledge, while Nagarjuna portrays emptiness as the absence of essence in phenomena.

Both Kant and Nagarjuna accept the conventional, empirical reality of things, while simultaneously acknowledging their transcendental or ultimate unreality. For Kant, this epistemic duality is found in the distinction between phenomena and noumena, while Nagarjuna speaks of dependent origination and emptiness.

Now, before we dive too deeply into the similarities between Kant and Nagarjuna, a brief word on the relation between Kant and paraphilosophy, because we’ll find that the dialectical matrix will help us to understand all these connections more clearly. So, as many of you will know, paraphilosophy is based on a methodology called syntheorology, which aims to reveal the structure through which we can explain experience.

Syntheorology is analytical–it’s looking at what human beings actually believe about the world–and so it neither affirms nor denies any perspective. Critique is still fundamental to the method thought, because it challenges the assumption that we can be wholly objective in our reasoning; and this helps us to transcend the dogmatic adherence to particular views, revealing the subjectivity inherent in all claims to truth.

Syntheorology analyzes the dialectical nature of reason to uncover the structural constraints that shape its operation. That is, it exposes the innate oppositionality within reasoning itself. This is, again, critique as a kind of self-awareness. So, there’s an obvious similarity between syntheorology and the critical philosophy of Kant, which is also an analysis of the structure of reason.

As Kant's Critical Philosophy seeks to expose the limits of reason, thereby defining the boundaries of possible knowledge; paraphilosophy examines the dialectical structure of belief in order to define the possibilities of rationalization. In both, reason and belief must turn back upon themselves in order to be fully understood.

Kant uses transcendental argumentation to establish the necessity of certain categories of thought, asserting that these categories must be in place for our actual experience to occur–the categories are characteristics of the appearance of any object in general. So, Kant is mainly concerned with how phenomena are structured and known by a subject.

The dialectical matrix, on the other hand, is more of a meta-theoretical system that describes how the appearance of phenomena can be reasonably explained to exist. Kant's system is thus grounded in the synthetic a priori–the categories are synthetic a priori principles governing appearances–and in paraphilosophy, this is an abjectivist approach to epistemology.

Syntheology recognises this approach, and seeks to harmonise it with other ways to explain the nature of appearances–via the other quadrants. The major difference between Kant and paraphilosophy is that, in paraphilosophy, our rationalization of reality is a creative force that actively shapes the structure of appearances, whereas Kant held that perception is structured by fixed categories belonging to the subject.

That is, belief does not just passively filter experience; it defines the kinds of experiences that can be rationalized as possible, and so rationality coevolves with perception, broadening the range of experiences we can justify and thus bring into conscious awareness. Phenomenal reality can thus be seen as an iterative process of self-justification–an expansion of the kinds of experiences that can be rationalised in principle.

As rationality evolves, the more complex experiences we are able to justify and thus perceive. So, while both Kant and paraphilosophy recognize that reason is inherently structured by opposition, they diverge in their interpretation of this structure—specifically in how they explain why our reason is always structured by equally reasonable opposites.

Kant’s transcendental idealism holds that knowledge is constrained by the cognitive faculties of the mind, and paraphilosophy views reason as an autonomous, self-determining structure—a dialectical matrix. So whereas Kant situated reason within the boundaries of human cognition, paraphilosophy aligns more closely with Hegel in conceiving reason as a more universal dynamic autopoietic process.

So, we understand that there is a methodological similarity between Kant’s doctrine of the categories of understanding, which describe the “condition of the possibility of objects in general,” and the classes of the dialectical matrix, which describes the structure of the possibilities of human reason.

The dialectical matrix can be represented as a quadrant diagram, and it can be applied to analyze any major philosophical concept, such as knowledge, being, or value. And when we apply it to the notion of truth, we get four truth predicates, which correspond to what the Greeks referred to as the 'tetralemma', and the Indians as the 'catuskoti'.

And the catuskoti is the system employed by Nagarjuna in order to demonstrate the insufficiency of dialectical reasoning in explaining ultimate reality. Again, both Kant and Nagarjuna accept the conventional, empirical reality of things, while also acknowledging their transcendental or ultimate unreality.

The catuskoti, therefore, addresses questions about ultimate reality or the transcendental ground of the subject and object—which for Kant would be the noumena. Like Nagarjuna, Kant identifies certain contradictions in human reason that arise when reason extends beyond the limits of possible experience, and there does in fact appear to be a clear analogy between the antinomies of Kant and the kinds of questions that were addressed by Nagarjuna.

Both identify fundamental contradictions involving a thesis and an antithesis, each of which is deemed insoluble by logical thought. For instance, where Kant asks “Does the world have a beginning in time and is it limited in space?”, Nagarjuna asks: “Is there a transcendental substance, a primordial matter, that can be considered eternal?” Where Kant asks: “Do we have free will?”, Nagarjuna asks: “Is there an eternal, unchanging individual soul?” And where Kant asks: “Does an absolutely necessary being exist?”, Nagarjuna asks: “Is there a transcendental ground for the unity of subject and object—a Perfect Being, or God?” And in both Kant’s antinomies and Nagarjuna’s dialectic, we encounter a thesis-antithesis structure, where two opposing positions arise that cannot be reconciled through conventional reasoning.

Both thinkers use these contradictions to highlight the limits of reason and the failure of human thought in its attempts to grasp the ultimate nature of reality. Now, there is a sense in which the negative method of critique—while powerful in revealing the limits of reason—may be seen as incomplete, overly reliant on logic, and thus insufficient for addressing the full spiritual and soteriological significance of the potentially nonrational nature of ultimate reality.

As we saw in the previous videos, both Yogacara and Advaita Vedanta provide a more positive conception of the ultimate absence of a determinate ‘thing,’ suggesting that the ultimate reality can be expressed not only through negation but also through the affirmation of nondual experience. And in the upcoming sections, we will explore how post-Kantian philosophers, such as Schopenhauer, Fichte, and Hegel, address the corresponding limitation within Kant’s system—the problem of noumena, or the unknowable thing-in-itself.

And the way that all of these thinkers get to work in addressing the apparent incompleteness of the negative critical approach is by recognizing that the ultimate reality must be implicit in relative experience—in the phenomenal realm—and that, when understood this way, it can be characterized in a more positive way.

For example, Schopenhauer identifies the thing-in-itself with Pure Will, Fichte with Pure Ego, Hegel with Pure Spirit, Yogācāra with Pure Dynamic Perception, and Vedānta with Pure Conscious Being. In each of these systems, the ultimate is not just beyond comprehension but is also immanent in experience, and through this unmistakable recognition, it becomes possible to articulate and affirm the ultimate nature of reality.

The difference between Kant and Nāgārjuna’s Madhyamaka philosophy of course lies in their treatment of the topic of absolute knowledge. Kant does not claim that absolute knowledge is attainable because reason is inescapably structured by its own categories and oppositions. And while Madhyamaka agrees that it is impossible to overcome the contradictions of dialectical reason through dialectical reason alone, it does believe that it is possible through nondual spiritual insight, which transcends the oppositions that reason generates, such as the distinction between subject and object.

These distinctions are ultimately illusory, and thus the ultimate reality cannot be understood through concepts, but only through direct, nonconceptual experience. And thus, Madhyamaka, so as paraphilosophy, implements a quadrant system to show the mind what it cannot do—namely, escape the alternatives of thesis, antithesis, both, or neither.

Once the mind recognizes that it cannot escape the dialectical matrix, it may then come to realize that it need not try to escape it. It is this surrendering of knowledge that opens the door to intuitive insight. Critique is thus the meta-level awareness of the essential bias inherent in human thinking.

Critique exists at the limit of thought because nothing beyond it can be intellectually grasped in a strictly positive way. Nagarjuna, and the Buddha before him, tell us that the inadequacy of our views results from the inclination to ascribe inherent existence to whatever it is that our views refer to, but even emptiness itself is an empty concept that becomes subject to critique if taken as a view.

Critique tells us what is not ultimately true, but it does not tell us what is ultimately true—only direct experience can reach reality, which cannot be an object of belief. The ultimate truth is not to be found in any particular perspective, but in understanding the nature of understanding itself. It is found in the dispassionate awareness of duality, and the freedom from bias which is its ground.

When this truth is allowed to manifest in our lives, then we call it peace. Hence, Madhyamaka literally means the “middle way” between extreme viewpoints, because it transcends both positive and negative positions. In a similar way, paraphilosophy literally means “beyond philosophical perspectives”—not in the sense of rejecting them outright, but in the sense of recognizing that all perspectives are inherently limited and must be seen as complementary aspects of our attempt to rationalize that which cannot be rationalized.

It is precisely because we cannot ultimately rationalise reality, that there is such a thing as relative truth, where multiple perspectives are valid. The ultimate truth is the lived absence of the dogmatic adherence to perspective. Relatively speaking, it is the fact that no perspectives are ultimately true.

But it’s not pure nothingness, because its indeterminateness is causally powerful. It is only in the unrestrictedness of non-discrimination that the restrictedness of relative existence becomes possible. The ultimate truth is the freedom for creativity. The key to understanding any paraphilosophical teaching therefore is to come to see it not merely as a rationalistic device for avoiding the dogmatism inherent in reason, but to use it as a tool to allow you to directly recognise the peace that is found in the absence of discriminating between alternatives.

It’s not something to accept, it’s something to do, or stop doing. The ultimate object of thought is the very thing that makes thought possible while being unthinkable in itself. There is just one thing to truly understand, which is our inherently dispassionate ability to understand or not. In mistakenly believing that our ability to understand and what we might understand are separate, we make the one appear as two.

Paraphilosophy is the power of the absence of a way things must be, which allows us the creative freedom to conjure up the relative truths of concepts and objects. And when we understand the critique as not merely a dismissal of all ideas, but as the openness of belief itself, then the ability for belief stops being a search for ultimate truth, and becomes a window into the ultimate truth.

To finish, a section from my book: “What we are attempting to explain in philosophy is purely our ability to explain. Reality is our evolving capacity to envisage what could be, and all perception is an act of creation, just as it is of discovery. Paraphilosophy is not a theory, and so not something to be posited or believed.

Paraphilosophy reverses the emphasis from whatever it is we could believe in, to the act of belief itself—of discriminating between opposites. All beliefs rely on the exclusion of disbeliefs. Paraphilosophy is recognizing that it is the conscious act of separation which leads to the development of reality—the creator is the separator—and so we can never disbelieve in paraphilosophy, for then we would disbelieve in our ability to believe, which is the foundation of all reason, and all reality.” “And so, paraphilosophy is a radical reinterpretation of the function of belief; understanding that freedom is gained in the detached observance, rather than the ascription, of belief; and that the ability for belief is the real thing that itself is always looking for, yet cannot find, because it is it.” And that brings us to the end of the video.

I should also mention that Kant does propose that we can establish an indirect connection to the noumenon through practical reason, and faith in a moral foundation for the world. So, if we suspend reliance on rational explanation, we open to the possibility of a different kind of knowing. Next, we’ll explore how Georg Hegel brings the noumenal back into the light of reason, whereby reality may be comprehended dialectically through the unfolding of self-consciousness.
