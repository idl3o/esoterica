## Transcript

hello guys I'm sorry to inform you but I've decided to quit philosophy and I'm turning this channel into a car review Channel sorry I couldn't say that with a straight face the reason I'm standing in front of this Audi A6 from 2007 is because this is going to be my home for the next two or three weeks because I've decided to go on a trip across the South of England and there's a good reason why I'm going on this trip but I'll tell you all about that later on right now I'm just outside glastenbury and I'm going to be making my way Northeast towards Cambridge so I hope some of you find this a little bit interesting it's very different than my normal stuff but I hope you enjoy and the first thing I set out to do is to look for a bush no really I heard that there was a bush of some significance or other laying in a field overlooking the tour from the opposite side of the valley I really did try my best to find the so-called glastenbury Thorn but I think it may be on land that isn't easily accessible to the public I've since read about the thorn online and it appears that it was like all good things destroyed by the land owner in 2019 nevertheless there is another grafting of the original thorn in a nearby churchyard so that we'll have to do Glastonbury is a town en sconed in the bucolic Splendor of Somerset yet it transcends its geography with its fascinating history and Legend highlighted by the looming glastenbury tour and the Vernal rights of its well attended music festival and in this seemingly unassuming local resides one legend that melds both history and horiculture the law recounts that Joseph of arthia who was esteemed as the custodian of none other than Jesus's burial rights embarked upon a post Resurrection sojourn to glastenbury in a gesture both mundane and miraculous he planted his staff Into The Verdant Earth of warial Hill now under ordinary Botanical principles this staff would simply wither but this is glastenbury and in an extraordinary deviation from vegetative Norms it sprouted forth and blossomed Into The glastenbury Thorn Tree this story is documented at least as far back as the year 1520 and this tree was not of a commonplace variety for the glastenbury thorn defies seasonal predictability by blooming twice a year once around Christmas and again around Easter how very curious indeed after that I walked into the town glastenbury is a unique town in the United Kingdom as pretty much everything about it is colored by New Age spirituality the people the shops and for some even the water it's been a settlement since Neolithic times and has been a site of religious importance since before the emergence of Christianity Today it serves as a center of operations for a number of different faiths including Sufism druidism harri Krishna the bahah faith and Eastern Christianity I didn't get this on camera but as I was walking back to my car I passed one of the Sacred freshwater Springs of glastenbury the white spring which is connected to a public tank app along a lane leading up to the tour as I walked past there was a young chap wearing Harem pants and a silly hat who was holding a little yellow gun actually it was a water pistol and he was filling it up with the spring water and asking passers by if they would like a holy baptism I watched as he failed to convince several Walkers to accept his Blessing so as I approached and he asked me would you like a holy baptism I said yes please he then proceeded to spray water in my face and I said thank you he said you have been blessed and I continued walking water dripping off my chin this is probably a good opportunity to explain what on Earth I'm doing driving around the country sleeping in my car if you're unfamiliar with this channel then this might sound a bit strange but I can only speak as though you are when I was a teenager in 2012 I began having profound experiences and these experiences revealed to me a truth that I was convinced could change the world must change the world I became obsessed with understanding the experience and this led me to philosophy I knew that personal experiences and anecdotes cannot be trusted so I used my insight to formally present resolutions to the disagreements we have within academic philosophy after 3 years by 2015 I had developed a new approach called parap philosophy in 2019 an academic publisher agreed to publish my work and for the last year and a half I've been trying to promote parap philosophy on the present Channel if you've keeping up with my videos you will also have noticed that I have begun now to talk about the insights that led me to the development of parap philosophy and you will be familiar with the distinction I make between righteousness and pleasure to simplify this significantly the distinction is between looking inside for the answers versus looking outside for the answers by looking inwards I was able to realize some very important things but it meant that I had to stop looking outwards and that created a lot of problems in my life we'll pause here for now and come back to this in a moment I next stopped a short distance away in Wells which is the smallest city in England [Applause] this is vica's close and it's the oldest original residential street in Europe the hall was completed in 1348 with the houses Following over several subsequent decades [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this Grand building here is Wells Cathedral this is why it's a city and not a town and it was mostly built from between 1175 and 1239 although there has been a church on the site since the year 705 this is a site you're going to see a lot of on this trip cuz not only is it a chain of pubs that is always generous with the electrical outlets on display but also it offers what I suspect might be the cheapest pint in the country less than half of what you'll find anywhere else at under 3 quid if you're watching from across the pond this is a weather spoons a National Treasure and there's about a thousand of them scattered across England after doing a couple of hours of work I head back to the car and start driving towards the beautiful city of bath I always knew that I couldn't go on forever like I have been what I'm trying to teach is that the cause of all our suffering and disagreements lies in the belief that The Cure exists at the end of righteousness or pleasure respectively by devoting myself to righteousness I was able to find the intellectual solution precisely by not living the real solution for the solution lies in balance in not becoming addicted to any one side of Duality all of this is explained in my most recent videos for those who are interested but the point is that I pursued righteousness purely to bring back answers I could share with the world but I knew that I was hurting myself in the process the problem is that I feel I could forever bring back more answers I feel that there are more insights to be gained and it is incredibly hard for me to decide to turn my back on everything I have worked so hard to reach already it is a genuine addiction yet I also know that I cannot be the teacher I aspired to be if people have no real cause to trust what I say I know that I cannot teach through words and reason alone one can only teach through action I arrived to where I'd be staying at around 11:00 p.m.

and I was tired but I was even more hungry I should have really bought dinner at the pub but I was trying to save money so naturally I rented an ebike and cycled into the city to find a [Applause] McDonald's unfortunately the ebikes stopped working at midnight so I had to wait for a bus that would take me back and I ended up getting to sleep pretty late I slept really poorly so I was still tired in the morning honestly yesterday I was feeling kind of anxious about doing this whole thing probably because most of the time I live like a Hermit that works at a computer all day and this is something very different but as I start walking I start to feel a lot better today I'm planning to do a long walk I don't want to think too hard about where exactly to go so I took out a map of bath drew a big circle around it and decided that I would see how closely I can follow that Circle the reason I'm sneaking up here is because I'm trying to stay on my circle so I'll be doing weird stuff like this a few times on this walk bath is a city nestled amidst Rolling Hills and historically has proferred the therapeutic Allure of its aonomus Waters a legacy spanning centuries and one that distinguishes it as the Paragon of spar towns throughout the United Kingdom long before the Romans built BS and temples in this Valley on the river Avon from the year 60 AD the hot springs had long been known to the native Britains in the 17th and 18th centuries B was at the Apex of societal prominence for the act of partaking in its mineral Rich Waters was seen not merely as an Indulgence but as a Curative right individuals from every strata of society converged upon the city imbued with an unwavering belief in the salutary properties of its famed thermal Springs it was widely held that these Waters possessed the miraculous capacity to alleviate a penopoly of elements a otion that engendered an unprecedented surge in the consumption of this mineral Elixir yet the Waters of barf were mineral Rich indeed and this bestowed upon it a flavor that was robustly metallic evocatively earthy and distinctly sulfuric a sensory combination that was an acquired taste to say the least visitors stealed by the promise of good health thus endeavored to quaff the Bittersweet draft only to find their faces contort into grimaces that eloquently conveyed The Duality of their experience a collision of the pursuit of Wellness with the visceral reality of tasting something that might be better suited to Metallurgy than to Medicine most of the Walk has been uphill so far and I was a bit tired here so I sat down for a short break when I started walking again the heavens had opened as they tend to do in England and it started to rain here's another shortcut and I genuinely almost completely slid down this hill I found a cool tunnel that was an Old Railway line apparently it's 4 mil long but it wasn't on my circle so I didn't go through it the reason I've set out on this journey is twofold first I've been working tirelessly literally all day every day for many years I am completely exhausted actually I was completely exhausted years ago but I have kept on going because I have had a mission but now I am reaching a point where I have done much of what I can it is up to the world to respond to what I have offered and there is no use in torturing myself trying to get others to listen if they do not want to the second reason is simply that I feel that I should do this I have a feeling I cannot quite describe that is telling me that the time has come I need to make a change and that taking this short break is the first step on this new journey I eventually make it into the City and I was very hungry so I visit another shop that's likely going to be a regular on this trip Gregs the UK's most celebrated producer of sausage rolls and pastries and today the sausage rolls were on point [Music] I walk past the Roman baths towards the cathedral and as I watch these street performers I noticed the bloke next to me is staring at me I look at him and he looks away and then again he stares at me I look at him again and he looks away now sometimes in England this kind of Engagement is enough justification for a bout of fisty cuffs but I'm way above such pettiness so I decide against my Primal urges and [Applause] leave by the top of this here Hill I had become rather warm so I took off my jacket it was only then that I realized that I had bird poop all down my right shoulder I suppose this must have been why that chap was staring at me before this is a strange sport we play here in England called Cricket how it works is that one team sits on the side watching while two of their players hit a leather ball with a wooden bat the other team stands around in a certain Arrangement ideally in the sun hoping that the ball will come to them so that they can throw it back it truly is an exhilarating watch I finished my Loop this is how looked on straa and get back to my car just as it starts tipping it down with rain I don't know where I'm heading next I just know that I eventually need to make my way towards London [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
