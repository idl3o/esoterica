## Transcript

The world can be thought about in two different ways. We can think about it in terms of how it appears in our experience, or we can think about it independently of our experience of it. These two ways oppose each other and this leads to two possibilities. Either one of these ways of thinking is false, or the world might actually have two different parts, the mental and the physical.

It's possible that these two parts are complementary aspects of a single thing, each of which cannot exist on its own. It's like Carl Jung have also noticed that the ways people think fall into two different types, and the more you think in one way, the less you think in another. There are two different ways to categorize how people see the world.

Extroverts focus on the outside world, while introverts focus on their inside world. Philosophers rely on logical reasoning, feelers rely on personal values. What we find is that the different theories in philosophy align with the different ways people think. There are four different ways that we can learn something.

There are four different kinds of objects that could exist, and so on. And philosophers have built theories that rely on each of these four quadrants. We can therefore think about philosophical theories as growing out of this basic structure, and each of the four quadrants of this structure makes up a different way of looking at the world.

The objectivist worldview believes in science. It believes in the material world. It thinks morality is created by the mind, and it thinks that people should be free to do what they want. The subjectivist worldview, on the other hand, trusts our feelings. It believes in the mental world. It thinks morality is a real thing, and it thinks that people should all be equal to each other.

The third worldview, abjectivism, disagrees with both of these perspectives. It thinks that they are both expressions of a third kind of world, a world of pure information or mathematics. And finally, the fourth worldview, superjectivism, agrees with both the subjectivist and the objectivist. Only it denies that there is really any difference between them.

However, this worldview is quite rare, because the subjectivist and the objectivist seem to be in disagreement, so it's hard to see how they could be united. We'll come back to this a bit later. Common logic is based on two fundamental rules. First, opposing statements cannot both be false. One must be true.

And second, opposing statements cannot both be true. One must be false. Thus, every statement must be either true or false. But around a hundred years ago, philosophers and mathematicians began grappling with something known as the self-referential paradox. There are many ways it can be expressed, but in its most simple form, it is the sentence, this sentence is false.

If this sentence is true, then it must be false. But if it is false, then it must be true. It's continually turning into its opposite, because it is denying what it is asserting. And despite our best efforts to resolve the paradox with common logic, a solution could not be found. However, it could simply be that common logic is wrong.

It could be that a statement is not always either true or false. If we accept this, all our problems fade away. And because of this, there are now different opinions on which rules of logic are valid, and these opinions also fit into our four quadrants. We can assert that some statements are neither true nor false, or neither provable nor disprovable.

Or we can assert that some statements are both true and false, or both provable and disprovable. Each of these options requires getting rid of one of the basic rules of thinking. Either the idea that opposing statements cannot both be true, or the idea that opposing statements cannot both be false might be wrong.

And since these two options are themselves, the opposites of each other, they could themselves both be true, or indeed false. So once more, the most obvious ways that we can resolve the self-referential paradox fit into the same structure as all other topics in philosophy. Now, I know that was probably a little confusing, but we're approaching a really important realization.

Which logic is the true logic is a matter of perspective? Just as which philosophical theories are true is a matter of perspective. With us, we cannot rely on logic to claim that opposing philosophical theories cannot both be true. For we do not even know what basic logical rules are true. In other words, it could be the case that all four perspectives are true and form part of a greater whole.

Furthermore, the same quadrant diagram can be used to describe the different parts of human thinking. The opposition between the two basic logical rules mirrors the opposition between the brain and the mind. The brain is like a machine, and therefore it cannot generate the idea of a paradox. But the mind works through symbols and has no problem thinking of the idea of a paradox.

Another smart man named Douglas Hofstadter provided a very convincing argument that there is an endless cycle of information between these two different kinds of logical systems, the brain and the mind. And this loop is what creates our feelings of self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is also a kind of loop because it's always referring to itself.

It is a subject that perceives, and it's also an object that is perceived, and thus it must be located in the bottom right quadrant of our diagram because this refers to a unity of the subjective perspective of the mind and the objective perspective of the brain. Philosophy in general must refer to itself because it tries to explain the world and within the world is philosophy.

It is both the subject and the object of itself, and so it can never find a solid foundation. But I am presenting a new approach called para-philosophy, which can explain why the subjective and the objective viewpoints seem to contradict each other. And it achieves this by explaining the significance of self-reference in philosophy.

By studying the quadrant diagram, we can learn that superjectivism is talking about self-reference. It is the knowledge of knowledge, the being of being, the value of value, and the freedom of freedom. While superjectivism has previously been thought of as a contradiction, we can now show that it is a perfectly reasonable perspective to take.

Now, because the quadrant diagram describes philosophical perspectives, and also the different parts of our experience, we must seriously consider whether the structure of all perspectives is really the foundation we've always been looking for. Remember, logic and the different ways we can define truth also conform to the structure, and so there is no logical reason to deny that all of the quadrants might be true.

Fortunately, we don't need to worry about this question, for the answer is already clear. The structure only makes sense if it's taken as a real thing. That is because we already know that the structure is self-referential. The bottom right quadrant proves this. So inside the superjective perspective, inside consciousness is all for quadrants.

Consciousness is both a single quadrant of the structure, and it's the space in which the structure exists as a whole. The quadrant diagram is identical to self-consciousness, and self-consciousness is self-justifying, because it is a unity of logical necessity and experiential verification. That's what the analytic aposteriori means.

During these two facts, the entire quadrant diagram must also be self-justifying. The structure is simply an expression of how the fundamental truth of existence becomes separated through evolution into different parts that can be understood by finite human minds. Philosophy has traditionally assumed that reality exists in a particular way, and its goal has been to discover what that particular way is like.

This is a mistake. Our very attempts to understand reality is what creates reality. For reality is contained within consciousness. The world is a representation of consciousness's ability to understand itself, and to understand how it understands. Reality is infinitely complex, and it can only understand itself by learning little by little.

We call this evolution. Indeed, reality can only exist by becoming real gradually. We are simply witnessing the process by which the world creates itself, which means it's not completely real right now. The world that we experience is a representation of how much that world understands itself. The beginning of evolution is a state of understanding nothing, and the end of evolution is a state of understanding everything.

And in fact, these two states are the same. It's a circle. Evolution goes from a non-dualistic state to a dualistic state, and then back to a non-dualistic state, because we need duality in order to learn. The two sides of duality are the mental world and the material world. Philosophy must stop trying to explain one side of duality in terms of the other.

For the duality is real. Mind does not need to be explained by matter nor matter to be explained by mind. The sides of reality have been pulled apart to allow consciousness to understand and to become itself. Remember to learn is to create. Since these two halves are ultimately aspects of a whole, there must be a correlation between them, and we can study this correlation to understand things in science that we've not been able to understand before.

Mental truth is always correlated with physical truth. Reality is generated as we learn about it, and we learn about it as it is generated. Creation and discovery are one. Mind and matter are separated by evolution, and this allows us to perceive the world as though it was separate from ourselves. And a time will come when the process of separation will end, and the process of reunification shall begin, and we shall reintegrate into the objective world.

The only true philosophical science must be a science of the self. The absolute truth is that there is no absolute truth, and this paradox is the ultimate reality, and the source of all creativity and power, it is infinite freedom. Everything is one single self, and the process of the self learning of itself is also the process of the self creating itself.

The world comes into being because to exist is to know thyself, and because it is the sole function of the ultimate reality, the self-referential paradox to know itself. Self-reference is creation. The entire world is the creation of the self, of yourself. So celebrate, because we are waking up to this truth, and when we do, we shall have no choice but to love our world, which is our self.

Because the beginning of evolution is the end of evolution, and this means that we must reach the end, and survive all the barriers in our way, because if we do not reach the end, then there would never have been a beginning. But there was a beginning, so there will be an end. Celebrate, that everything is one, and that the one is you.

For if we know this simplest of facts, then we can build a science of wisdom. Then we shall know, and solve, and heal all things. This is only the first step, and it starts now.
