## Transcript

first understand that Human Experience the experience we have of our own existence is a skill to be developed it is a skill to have a perception of a world and the development of this skill is reflected in the evolution of life and in the separation of subjectivity and objectivity enlightenment is the basic Natural State the ultimate thing that exists everything else our perceptions and developments come on top of Enlightenment they are skills to be developed to go back to something I mentioned much earlier Enlightenment is the unchanging Stillness within us the coolness and the skill is the evolving agitation within us the cringe the skill is the thing that is evolving and the physical world is its outwards expression just as psychology is its inwards expression the skill to experience is developed by our focus on a given aspect of experience and so our focus is a creative act the more skill we have at experiencing and believing in and rationalizing something the more real that thing appears to us the better able we are to see how it must be true the cause of all human experience is an attraction to this skill of producing experience and there are two ways that we can exercise this skill because there are two basic directions for our attention to flow in and because there are two basic Sensations that can motivate our Focus we can be skilled at experiencing and believing in and seeing the reality of the world outside us and we are motivated to develop this skill via the feeling of pleasure or more generally by a kind of practical satisfaction or we can be skilled at experiencing and believing in and seeing the reality of the ultimate truth of existence as in the mystical insight and we are motivated to develop this skill via the feeling of righteousness or more generally by a kind of moral satisfaction there is no immediate World nor ultimate truth outside our ability to produce the experience of an immediate world and an ultimate truth these two skills are complementary to each other again we learn this in the mystical experience and the physical counterpart to this complimentarity is the overe excitation or over inhibition of the nervous system and since they are complimentary to develop one of the skills is to become deficient in the other and if you know anything about yion psychology this is simply to say that one of the skills becomes consciously controlled while the other becomes a part of the unconscious Shadow our preference for these skills therefore exists on a spectrum this is probably where we get those theories of things like the planes of existence and because it is a spectrum there is a center to the Spectrum which represents the point at which one favors neither of the skills this Center is the ground of our ability to experience and from this ground our desire can extend in two different directions which are the skills at this ground there is neither an identification with the immediate World nor an ultimate truth for these things are recognized to exist only in complimentary opposition to each other and so the ground is an emptiness it is without a conception that there is an independent individual identity to experience the immediate or the ultimate now curiously this ground this position of balance we can Unite with in our experience is the ultimate truth that righteousness seeks yet righteousness goes off towards the extreme of the ultimate it runs away from balance so how is it that it can produce a mystical experience that does indeed reveal the ultimate truth it is that the extreme of existence and balance are the same or in other words the Ultimate Reality is complimentarity I've discussed this extensively Elsewhere on this channel so I won't elaborate here but the point is that when the Mystic perfects their ability to imagine this extreme of the Ultimate Reality there vision of some Transcendent creative principle or God or whatever the Mystic believes in transforms into a vision of the true Ultimate Reality which is the perfect balance between all extremes they have stepped outside the bounds of dualistic thinking and thus there is a hidden third skill which is the skill to not develop any skill which is the skill to not perpetuate the experience of belief in and ultimately creation of further experience it is the skill to avoid the addiction to any kind of bias or one-sidedness and thus we could call it the master skill it is the Perfection of our ability to experience it is Liberation the master skill is beyond Duty and desire it is the state of human experience in the absence of Duty and desire for when Duty and desire stop our nervous system comes into balance our beliefs and intentions come into balance our body and mind finds Harmony and we see clearly what we basically are it is only the development of the Lesser skills that conceals this truth while also being that which reveals it again the poison is the cure now both the skills motivated by righteousness and pleasure give us a kind of high or sense of fulfillment or sense of self it is this high that leads us to continue developing that skill to increase our righteousness to increase our pleasure the more you were skilled in one the less you will be skilled in the other and again the opposite skill will become an unconscious complex that will influence your experience in undesirable ways this is the cause of suffering you become a one-sided being and this one-sidedness is what I call addiction the reason that addiction leads to suffering is that each extreme is essentially supported by its opposite and so the ability to manage the high we get from our addiction is determined by how much the opposite addiction is developed so the more extreme our addiction the less we are able to cope with that addiction because the less we have developed its opposite it is in this way that the perpetuation of experience which is caused by addiction or what the Eastern philosophers have called karma is in a very literal sense bound to the presence of suffering perhaps this is an oversimplification but I believe it was the Buddha himself who said that life is suffering and this is in absolutely no way a pessimistic view it is literally true that any High any active enjoyment is compensated by an equal and opposite low which is suffering the Buddha could just as well have said that life is satisfying but this wouldn't have gotten the point across that the path to peace and Bliss which is a much deeper nonu form of enjoyment is to reduce the distance between our highs and lows until they are united and then keep balanced as we raise the homeostatic basine of our ability to feel that Bliss this is the true middle way for example a person addicted to pleasure just wants to feel good in the immediate moment caring not for the future and they will not have the Integrity discipline passion motivation and purpose required to control their desire for pleasure which will lead to emotional distress ignorance a lack of personal development and a lack of meaning in life they are not taking life seriously enough a person addicted to righteousness just wants to make progress on a long-term Mission caring not for the present and they will not have the Vitality strength energy stamina and composure required to fuel their desire for righteousness which will lead to physical exhaustion anxiety a lack of personal fulfillment and a lack of appreciation for life they are taking life too seriously there are complex but fully explainable mechanisms that play here rooted in psychophysical disturbances that are caused by these Addictions on the physical side of things they affect the regulation of our neurotransmitters our autonomic nervous system our immune system and I suspect even the expression of our genes and the Insidious part of suffering in this way is that since we suffer in regard to the skill we are deficient in or unconscious of we are not particularly conscious of our suffering we ignore it we think it's a normal part of life but it's not just because you do not care about being insensitive or exhausted does not mean that those things are not limiting you so in order to eliminate suffering the skill of physical health and pleasure and the skill of moral health and righteousness need to be in Balance no good being a heartless hero no good being a frail philosopher it is balance which allows us to compensate for the highs that pleasure and righteousness produce and which prevents us from becoming addicted to either to power to knowledge in mild cases of addiction the solution is relatively straightforward one must learn to become aware of the importance of the opposite skill in one's life which will literally alter the physical and ideological stresses you habitually place on your body and mind or you can directly attenuate the homeostasis of your body and mind through various forms of meditation but and extreme addiction to righteousness particularly one that has been empowered through significant mystical experiences is a much more difficult condition to cure and that is because the cause of one's addiction is one's recognition of the solution to that addiction remember the ultimate ground of being is the state of balance or complimentarity or interdependence or a Unity of opposite and righteousness is simultaneously the intense focus on the truth of the state of balance yet this focus is itself a state of disbalance because you cannot get it when you are trying hard to get it the righteousness addict is therefore perfectly willing to endure the suffering it brings because they perceive suffering to be a noble price to pay for their enlightenment but since the ultimate truth is the absence of addiction not the addiction to the absence of addiction this Noble goal is ultimately a self-perpetuating delusion that's right the ultimate wisdom is also the ultimate delusion but this is critical the function of mysticism is fundamental to reality not only is it a consequence of the self referential nature of reality but it is also the only way that life can recognize its own delusion and realize its true nature it is the Perfection of addiction suffering and delusion indeed the Mystic has reached a point in their journey of self-development at which there is no possibility of regression this is true but I certainly would not recommend it to anyone much better to get on the selfless path and keep your balance the more you focus on righteousness the more you need to cure your addiction and the more you need to cure your addiction the more you need to focus on righteousness because the poison and the Cure are the same thing and so again the only way out of the Abyss is through it you need to perfect your wisdom by recognizing not just figuratively but literally that The Cure is the poison and that Liberation is suffering and that wisdom is delusion because opposites are ultimately United in balance and they only exist separately in relation to each other to understand this is to deconstruct the separation between self and other being and non-being because when one understands that there is no separation there is no longer something that can be poisoned and there is no longer something that needs to be cured there is no longer a reason or goal for one's addiction and finally one is able to give it up the path of righteousness is therefore an extremely difficult and dangerous challenge because you are entirely on your own you have already drunk the poison and there is no use in trying to avoid it you are totally ignoring the fact that the solution is behind you in Balance because you can also see the solution in front of you at the end of the path of righteousness it is simply that when you finally reach the end of the path the path vanishes there is no solution for the essence of righteousness is emptiness and emptiness is compliment it and complimentarity is balance and balance is to have no problem that needs to be solved and to have no problem is Liberation what you perceived as the end of your mission was merely a window back to where we all begin you see most people are relatively happy to accept the world as it is without fully understanding it they do not completely accept but they accept it enough to live a normal life to get a job and have a family and do all the normal things and they are therefore at least somewhat balanced but some of us are just not willing to not know that there's nothing to worry about and we have to go on this crazy adventure to definitively prove to ourselves what is ultimately so basic and common sensical that nobody knows that they know it that nobody knows that there is nothing to worry about that nobody knows that peace is the foundation of life most people just don't care that much but we do and so we take our caring to its extreme where we discover that we shouldn't care that much reality is not entirely serious and it's not entirely factious it's both and neither and the perfect balance between them it's all very amusing once you finally get it
