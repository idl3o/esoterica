## Transcript

This is the dialectical matrix for the notion of socio-political right, and it is largely equivalent to what is sometimes referred to as the political compass. And this is the final of four videos discussing human kinds inclination towards the top left quadrant of the dialectical matrix towards a hypothetical ideology I call abjectivism, which reflects a neutral position that seeks to achieve some form of balance between the extremes of subjectivism and objectivism respectively.

In part one, we discussed how intelligence tends to lead us away from appearances and towards a more explanatory complete and inclusive perspective. In part two, we discussed some of the issues with denying experience in favour of such a transcendentalist position. And in part three, we discussed the alternative dual aspect monism approach, which embraces both mind and matter, without succumbing to an ontological dualism.

In the present video, I shall elucidate a novel political theory called bi-doctoralism. I report this theory not as a result of any concerted efforts to discern the ideal political structure, nor even as an expression of my own particular psychological inclination. I, as with everyone else, value certain things more than others.

And often our political orientation honours a state of society that would best cater to what we, in particular, value. Insofar as we all value different things, attempting to convey that society should respect our values more than those of others is merely a form of ideological domineering. I report this theory because it is implied by a larger philosophical system, and as I and hundreds of others have begun to believe, this system provides resolutions to practically all of the major problems of philosophy.

This is simply the socio-political system, according to my best interpretive efforts that appears to be derivable from para-philosophy. If you want to understand why this theory is implied, you can get a good idea by watching the prior videos in this series, but I will not be focused on justifying it here.

As such, all this remains highly theoretical, and I am open to feedback on what could be improved. Before we go into detail about this theory, allow me to recap what we learnt previously, but is particularly relevant to the present topic. In part 1, I explained how the basic duality of belief satisfaction, that is why we believe what we believe manifests within political thought.

Here, the subjectivist believes we have a principle right to equality, and therefore leans naturally towards more authoritarian and socialistic regimes. While the objectivist believes we have a principle right to liberty, and leans naturally towards more libertarian and capitalistic regimes. Insofar as more equality means less liberty, and as more liberty means less equality, the egalitarian and the libertarian become political opponents, as characterized by the opposition between the so-called left and the right.

The abjectivist perspective, which is neither subjectivist nor objectivist, therefore represents a view which is not disproportionately devoted to equality or liberty respectfully. The paradigmatic abjectivist is an intelligent, introverted, and independent thinker who recognizes the equal worth of both values, who recognizes the implicit conflict between the values, and who recognizes the need to balance them against each other, accepting the inevitable inequality and authority required to establish such a balance, which results in authoritarian individualism.

Of the four major classes of political theory, authoritarian individualism, including the more extreme state capitalism, and the less extreme liberal politocracy is, by comparison, most applicable to the modern developed world. It refers to political systems that value obedience to and support from an authority as a means of maintaining the social structure, and which is supported via taxation within a competitive market.

Religion individualism shares its position in para-philosophy with moral objective relativism, which can be related to Isaiah Berlin's value pluralism. This position holds that objective values exist, but they conflict with each other in such a way that multiple valid judgments can be made of a single circumstance.

Crucially, liberty may conflict with equality, and we may be required to make choices that violate one or the other. Authoritarian individualism is thus a pragmatic means of maintaining balance in society, but it is also a natural outcome of the democratic process. The libertarians pull away from equality, the egalitarians pull away from liberty, and the net result is inevitably relative neutrality.

In part 2 and 3, we covered some of the metaphysics of para-philosophy, distinguishing transcendental abjectivism, which argues that mind and matter are mere illusions, and that reality is grounded in some unperceived, neutral stuff, from the para-philosophical view of dual aspect monism, which recognizes that mind and matter are necessary expressions of a unified reality, whereby the abjective refers simply to the correlation between them.

And so we are now in a position to extend our conclusions to politics. Moderatism, expressed in this case by state capitalism, is an attempt to establish neutrality in the absence of duality. It is a rejection of the reality we experience in favour of a transcendent middle ground. Dist as mind and matter must be considered necessary, independent, a causal yet corresponding expressions of reality, so too must equality and liberty be considered as distinct yet equally justified virtues of social life.

Attempting to rule this duality with a single system is tantamount to the reductionistic effort to reduce the subject and object together which can only be met with compromise, and ultimately the failure of that society. So now, what is the solution? We already know that equality and liberty conflict with each other, and we have seen first hand with the communist movement that the attempt to force them together leads to even more destruction and depravity than rejecting them both altogether.

Paraphilosophy teaches us that the right to liberty and equality respectively applies to different domains of reality, and so we should not accept a compromise between them. The libertarian perspective applies to the concrete realm of matter. The collectivist perspective applies to the abstract realm of ideas.

These two images of our world do not conflict when they operate in entirely disjointed domains, rather they complement. Just as there is no mind interfering with matter, there is no equality interfering with liberty. Instead, there is simply an a causal correlation between them. The essential point that we must realise therefore is that, at least at the relative level of phenomenal experience, we effectively exist in two different worlds.

These worlds often seem towards like one for they are in inexorable harmony with each other, but as we discussed in the previous video, they are causally separate. These two worlds are not merely different, they are complementary, inversions of each other, and so each of our worlds operates in accordance with a different system of value, indeed a different ethical system, which demand different political systems.

And because we are no longer bound by the monistic and modernist inclination towards compromise and balance, these two systems may be taken to their extremes. Monarcho-capitalism for the material, state socialism for the ideal. The interests and purview of each aspect of society would then be defined by the dialectical matrix in terms of the corresponding notion of value.

Material goods like new cars and foreign holidays are luxuries that have value relative to the subject and are satisfied through libertarian individualism. Ideal goods, on the other hand, like wealth and well-being, are necessities whose value is objective and absolute, and which are satisfied through authoritarian collectivism.

I have tended to refer to this pair as the facetious and serious domains respectively. Everyone exists in both systems and indeed both worlds, but the facetious objectivist domain is private and unique to each individual while the serious subjectivist domain is public and shared between everyone. This model, which I have absolutely named by doctrinalism, is a means of maintaining harmony with the state of our social evolution and is therefore something that should gradually manifest in the world before dissolving again sometime in the future.

Just as the distinction between mind and matter is an evolutionary tool for developing self-reflection, by doctrinalism is an evolutionary tool for developing self-governance and self-ownership. It is indeed a radical idea, but I wager it will begin to sound more and more rational the more and more you think about it.

I'll move on to how this would work practically in a moment, but let us just consider what our politics attempt to do already. Conservatism and liberal politocracies across the globe already attempt to differentiate between the wants and needs of society through different kinds of policy. By doctrinalism merely takes this one step further, by recognising that we can only get so far while the serious and facetious are governed by a single system of value.

This value system is underscored by the concept of money and is regulated by the rule of law, applying the same system of value to both our wants and needs is the perfect recipe for injustice and greed. By doctrinalism can be thought of as an idealised liberal conservatism, it is constructed gradually over time, and it may well be that its construction is not even deliberate, that it is inevitable that we move towards by doctrinalism due to the forces of evolution, but then it is eventually deconstructed when mankind finally conquers his evolution, when equality and liberty, so as subjectivity and objectivity are united in experience completely.

So, the major challenge with implementing a system of this nature is obviously that it requires a complete re-evaluation of our store of value, but this is also what makes it incredibly attractive. Wealth generated in the facetious domain could not be used to gain advantage over others in the Sirius, and so by doctrinalism implies the complete dualisation of our monetary powers.

Possibly the system would entail the use of two distinct currencies, with limited means of exchange between them, serious money could be used within the Sirius domain, as facetious money is used within the facetious, but no amount of riches gained from facetious success can afford you higher standards of healthcare or education and so on in the Sirius.

In the Sirius domain, work could be performed for renumeration in credit rather than traditional currency, whereby serious goods are effectively traded in exchange for a service. This service would be a public service, so that all members of society contribute towards the good of the whole. Of course, legislating that all individuals must fulfil a humanitarian duty is rather authoritarian, but Sirius' legislation would now be built upon a foundation of objective moral values.

Nevertheless, there are many ways to move slowly towards such a system without the radical implementation of new legislation. For example, we could build upon the current system of taxation to inculcate a new type of industry in which facetious profit is paid directly to individuals working to fulfil a person's Sirius liability.

Many careers in the public sector of course require education, training and full time attention, so there may also be a means of facetious renumeration for any work that exceeds one's duty. In fact, the workforce need not change significantly from how it exists today, and again, the current system of taxation already exists to reallocate currency from the private to public sectors.

The important factor is the bifurcation of our monetary instruments. By doctrinalism could even provide a role for the use of cryptocurrency that does not offend the financial industry, as it seems, understandably, to be doing today. The result of a dualisation of capital would be that the Sirius could remain as a solid store of wealth, where there is no inflation, no profit and total public expenditure.

The value that we currently place on money, which is the cause of so many of our issues, would be completely dismantled, for our comfort and our safety would no longer depend on it, and in regards to Sirius goods there would be no such thing as the rich and the poor. On the other hand, the facetious domain would be unrestrained by policy, allowing for the total realisation of liberty within it.

Its currency would be liquid, granting the free exchange of goods, and there would be no taxation on profits that are gained. There would also be no centralized law in the facetious, for it is not the domain of objective morality. Instead, the system would be self-regulated in an open competitive market, and in accordance with the principles of anarcho-capitalism.

There may be incentives, but there are no punishments for facetious misdeeds, and the only limitation is that the facetious does not overstep its bounds and impact on the Sirius. Whether one wishes to participate in the facetious domain at all is a matter of individual choice, and abstaining shall have no influence on one's basic standard of living.

If we choose to partake in the game, then success can bring wealth and fame, but we need not fear for our livelihood, if we should fail, nor shall riches and renown be the only markers of success. Success in the facetious domain can never place one person above another. For when we all go back home, we shall, so to speak, lie in precisely the same bets.

Facetiously, we are free to be unequal, but seriously, we are bound to equality. Power is given a new meaning under by doctrinalism, but this does not make it any less rewarding. On the contrary, facetious success can only be a greater pleasure, for it is clear from the start that riches and happiness are not the same thing, so that we shall never expect they should be in alignment.

Passions shall be pursued for their own sake, without restraint or fears of regret, purely for the purpose of realising our unique individuality. So to summarise, by doctrinalism is an alternative to the forced compromise between liberty and equality that is necessitated by any moderate doctrine. Just as eliminative materialism and idealism are true of the objective and subjective worlds, pure liberty and pure equality are justified for each domain of civil life.

The conflict between cooperation and competition, between charity and profit will always give rise to disparity if they are permitted to interact. Grace and greed pull the rope of society in opposing directions, and this creates profound tension within the system. Power philosophy teaches us that the only way to relieve this tension is to entirely sever the rope into two.

The only way, one day far in the future, to arrive at a utopian libertarian collectivist society capable of uniting liberty and equality in a single doctrine is if everybody was an ideal moral agent. And until a lot changes in our world, this remains an impossible task. To boot, power philosophy dictates that liberty and equality will only be united in the same system when the objective and the subjective are united in our perception, representing the complete actualisation of self-consciousness within the superjective.

In the absence of a ubiquity of ideal moral action and the collective enlightenment of humankind, by doctrineism presents the only way to instantiate these values in their extremes without eliminating social difference or monopolising economic power. I must reiterate however that I do not present this thesis on economic or sociological grounds nor am I qualified to attempt to do so.

There will be many problems to be found in the idea, some I see already and some I surely don't. But there will also be solutions to these problems, solutions that work and solutions that don't. I ask that you do not take the incompleteness or implausibility of the idea as a reason to reject it outright, for it may one day become clear that it is precisely the kind of radical system we may need.

It is precisely the kind of radical system that para-philosophy demands we do need. Para-philosophy presents the dialectical matrix as a representation of the structure of the process through which self-consciousness travels in the generation and realisation of itself. The process begins in objective unconsciousness at the dawning of our biological evolution.

It then develops into the duality of subject and object where we recognise the world is separate from ourselves and it ends in the superjective non-duality of self-consciousness where we recognise our oneness with the all. And so it is in all domains of inquiry the subjectivist and objectivist perspectives on any notion eventually unite in the superjective.

The way I see the development of all life can be boiled down to this. Evolution is a two-player game. That includes the development of reality, but it also includes the development of society. We have the lofty ideal of developing from a state of dependence and disparity to one of liberty and equality, from authoritarian, individualism to libertarian, collectivism, but there is no single path between them.

It's like the dialectical matrix contains a hidden dimension, a pyramid rather than a two-dimensional square, and we cannot traverse the mountain between the opposites. The path to our left leads to liberty and the path to our right leads to equality. Even if we reach a state where one of these values finds its extreme, we could never get beyond it to a reconciliation with its opposite because evolution is a two-player game.

There is a gate barring inequality from equality and there is a gate barring authority from liberty. The key to the former is found at the latter and the key to the latter found at the former. We could think of these keys as pressure plates that only unlock the gates while we are present upon them, and only when both keys are activated at precisely the same time shall both gates open, and there is simply no way to pass a gate on one's own.

We must cooperate so that they shall no longer be our enemies, but our allies different and opposite to ourselves all the same, but nevertheless working towards the same goal, which is the sovereignty that is our birthright. There is no physical evolution that is not also mental, and there is no perfection of the capital that is not also a perfection of the social.

Everything is already in harmony, and there is only the fight against it.
