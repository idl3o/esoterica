## Transcript

it will be useful here to mention a distinction I've discussed before on this channel between two basic feelings that can motivate Us in life righteousness is the feeling one has when focused on apprehending the ultimate nature of reality and opposed to it is pleasure which is the feeling one has when focused on apprehending the sensory world don't get too stuck on the words right ious and pleasure these are just labels and one can feel either regardless of what one is focused on the key difference is that the former facilitates our interest in understanding the moral significance of human existence while the latter facilitates our interest in the more worldly practical significance of human existence so there is a loose analogy here again to spirituality versus science this isn't to say that scientists are all hedonists but that it's the same kind of motivation that leads one to care more about one's physical state as it is to care more about the physical nature of the world as opposed to the moral state of the same we might also think of righteousness as the attempt to apprehend the Stillness within us and pleasure as the attempt to indulge in our agitation but both are forms of agitation and both can motivate us to take certain actions in life peace is thus the opposite of both these things it is not trying to apprehend either the ultimate or immediate reality the path to peace therefore has to do with where one places one's attention in one's mind how one exercises one's capacity to believe in ideas and how One Associates with the feelings of one's body it is a point of balance between both righteousness and pleasure where we are not seeking to lean more in One Direction than the other mystical experiences are therefore not the path to peace because they are concerned with apprehending the nature of Ultimate Reality which fuels the feeling of righteousness nevertheless the mystical experience is a window to the path it reveals what and where the path is but it itself is the opposite of the path it is a form of agitation the mystical experience is therefore in part a realization that that very realization is not Liberation and when you know what isn't the path you can now see what is in this way agitation is necessary for the realization of Stillness just as Stillness is necessary for agitation again they are interdependent and complimentary so again righteousness makes us feel like we are apprehending the fundamental nature of reality as in spirituality or religion and pleasure makes us feel like we are apprehending the immediate nature of sensory experience as in science to find peace one needs to walk the fine line between between righteousness and pleasure which for me would obviously mean to stop being so addicted to righteousness and the mystical knowledge I am sharing with you now which is actually giving me the solution to the problem I am creating by discovering that very solution we shall see that wisdom is like a feedback loop of desire in this sense
