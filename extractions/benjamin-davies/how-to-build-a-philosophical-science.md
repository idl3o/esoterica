## Description

Talking about how create a science of philosophy and some of it's implications. My book is called 'The Shape of Knowledge: An Introduction to Paraphilosophy' and will be released in 2023. Here's a short description:

The Shape of Knowledge is the outcome of a meaningful experience that occurred in 2012. In it are developed the foundations of a new science of philosophy, which promises to provide a solution to the disparity preventing our discourse from progress. Through the language of the Weste

## Transcript

Hello, so I'm back again with another walk and another ramble because it is almost 30 degrees today in the UK where I am at least. It's actually only a couple days after I recorded the last video. This is such a nice day. I thought I'd come out and record my favourite walk which is just outside my front door.

I think for this video I will try and just talk about some of the philosophy I've been working on just to get used to talking about it. It's very different like speaking about something and writing about something. I think until I've explained a sufficient amount of the philosophy, it's hard to understand that I definitely don't want anyone to be convinced of anything.

It's the structure between people's differences in opinion that I'm interested in, not any particular opinions. I'm very happy that people have opinions because if they didn't, I'd have nothing to study. It's the structure and the relations between the temperament, psychology and opinions that really forms the foundation of my science.

If you're trying to make a heavily theoretical foundation for philosophy and the science of it, you really have little to use as a foundationism. I guess some analytic claimed can be used as a foundation like with Descartes' philosophy. I think there for him is an analytic claim but how you derive the entirety of philosophy from a simple claim like that.

It's so basic that it's hard to see how you can derive consequences for political theory with meta-ethics and normative theories and stuff from these first principles. To develop the foundations of a genuine science philosophy, you need to use philosophical facts as opposed to philosophical facts and philosophical facts about philosophy.

They're not necessarily purely philosophical. They are to a large degree, psychological facts. For example, it is a fact that materialism is a theory, lots of us have come up with it's a fact that empiricism, rationalism, ideedism, roll absolutism, these are all theories. That is a fact because we can look in the historical records and we can look in our history books and find those facts or find those instances of theory.

That's the only way you can found a science of philosophy and it's the perfect way. It is the method that my work takes to find a science of philosophy. It's in the structural isomorphisms between these facts about the kinds of theories we've come up with and the way that the brain works at a basic level and the body physiologically.

The isomorphism is missing between them but also between the possibility of understanding the notion of truth and the concept of truth and how it predicates the sentences and things like that. By revealing a structural isomorphism between these things, really between logic and psychology, you can at least demonstrate that something's determining all of them to appear in a similar way.

That something might be an external factor, it might be the psychological structure, it might be the biology, it might be the truth for the civil truth and if we assume that multiple perspectives are true. I think throughout the history of philosophy, philosophers have assumed, understandably, that if these antithesis oppose each other and if classical logic is to be trusted then one of them must be false.

If there's a contradiction to be found in the idea that the world is material and between the idea that the world is mental then one of those ideas must be false. And as far as the false they must either be eliminated or reduced into the other and the great part of recent philosophy, at least in analytic tradition, has been to reduce this subject to the object perceived to reduce the reasoning mind to the mechanistic functions of the brain.

And it's been met with various challenges, challenges which would be better suited for a different video and other philosophers are experts in this subject. I really think that the reality is simple and the solution or the truth of all that is very simple. And that is, I suppose paraphrasing what Hagel proclaimed are approaches are very different, but what is rational is actual and what is actual is rational.

The fact that we perceive a duality means that that duality is actual or I suppose more accurately the fact that the reason in dualistic terms means that these dualisms are actual parts of the object. Of course, to demonstrate that the isomorphic structure that permeates our experience of the world and the possibilities of our attempts to rationalize that will doesn't necessarily mean that the structure or the contents of the structure are actual.

To put that in more simple terminology, the fact that we perceive a duality and reason a duality doesn't mean that that duality is necessarily real. Hello, one way to look at it with me, because it could imply a kind of transcendental aesthetic type argument, or which I mean, and Kant's perspective that results in transcendentalism whereby everything that human experiences is conditioned by the structure of their psychology, so that they can never see the real world, they translate the real world into these categories, and perhaps the structure is a part of that.

I don't believe that, because as Kant reasons to have a representation, there has to be something that representation is supposed to be of, whereas I would argue that this is reality, there is no transcendental. Let's see if we can get up here. Let's do one thing that I didn't completely finish talking about was how did you develop a science of philosophy, because you prove that there's a structure that's determined by something going on.

And you demonstrate that our ideas in philosophy are not entirely free, they are conditioned by real factors concerning phenomenal experience. There's a reason, there's a structure permeating the theories of philosophy, and I'll have to do another video talking about this structure and how we go about uncovering it, but obviously that's a big part of the book.

The first part of the book, you really need a way for the structure to demonstrate its own existence. You can't take something outside of it, and then use that something to prove that it's real, because everything is a part of the structure, because the structure is the structure of our own ability to rationalize what could be real, or what could be absolutely true yet isn't.

Everything has to be self-referential, but it has to be a self-position, which is inseparable from self-being. It has to be the self-position of the structure itself that necessitates its own being. If you can do that, you basically solve every problem of philosophy, and you prove that all perspectives are relatively real, and all ideas are relatively true, because they're a part of this structure, which is the thing that is the real thing, itself, the concept, the begra, the logos, the doubt, whatever you want to call it, that's the thing, and it is our own creativity, it's the source of everything.

It comes out of us, and we bind us to the light behind the eyes, the deepest part of the self. That's the thing we're searching for in philosophy, and by analyzing theories and creating theories, and arguing for theories through rhetoric, we are taking a little slice of this thing and presenting it as if it were a hold.

The reason we do that is because we cannot possibly stand the logical consequences of admitting perspectives that contradict each other, but it's how you rationalize the contradiction that is the important thing. You can have opposing thesis that true in regard to different aspects of the world or aspects of experience.

As long as you understand that what our theories are theories of is how the creativity is representing experience anyway. Just as you can have contradictions between viewpoints, you can have contradictions in how the reality expresses itself. That really is the essence of complementarity, because if you didn't need two expressions, we would have one.

Experience has parsimony built into it. It's that you cannot express everything about the absolute with a single onto category that we need duality in the world to put that different way. If we didn't need the mental to completely express the absolute reality, everything would just be material, but of course you can't express everything about the absolute through materiality, because then there's no recognition of meaning, and the recognition of meaning is a matter of so part of the absolute.

It's an iriscapable aspect of it. So complementarity is the resolution to paradox. It is how you express two things. It's how you express one thing in two ways. And the two representations are identical, even though they're different. They're inversions of each other. This is an incredibly powerful realization, because it means that for every psychological fact there's a physiological correlate, or I should say for every psychological ideal fact there's a physiological or physical correlate.

And just imagine if we can demonstrate that that is true, the breakthroughs of new uncovering science and in psychology. Imagine there's something we cannot penetrate to physically due to the current limitations of our instruments or otherwise perhaps in psychology because of ethical reasons. If you know how to correlate, mind and matter, and you can find out where something is correlated, you can then extrapolate to find out where are the things are correlated.

There might be something that's easy to discover in psychology whose correlate is almost impossible to discover in physics. But through an understanding of the correlations, you can then abduce what the correlate would be, and you can make genuine discoveries in physics. We'll talk about in the book by Dimitri Mendelov, who was the first person to develop the periodic table with chemical elements.

And obviously before we had this matrix of elements that are periodicized, the atomic numbers and masses and charge and all these different things of the elements, you couldn't discover a new element unless you've discovered it like empirically in the world. But if you have this table and you have all these elements placed upon it, then there's gaps in this table, then you can reason that there could be an element which should go in that gap.

And since you know the properties of everything else around it, you can work out what the properties of that element should be. And Dimitri Mendelov predicted the existence of a number of elements which were discovered like gallium and germanium and some others. And the amount of properties of those elements seems to be able to project is astounding.

Like you were able to actually predict like the melting point, the density, the boiling point, all those sorts of things, but these elements that had never been discovered physically in the world. So once we periodicize philosophy and extrapolate it to the domains of mind and matter, we can do so much.

That's why this works so important to me, because I think it will offer us great, great benefits. I think the political aspect of the science is probably the most important thing that that's definitely a conversation for another day. And there is the magical entrance to our walk. Which way to go? Do you go to the side of dark or to the side of light?

I like the look of that. Let's go down the darkness room. Maybe we've gone a bad way. This is definitely something for a castle, I would imagine. I think there's a little road there. This is probably enough information for one day. Oh, sidetracked. What a nice field this is. I mean, that is the life of your cow, isn't it?

Apart from the bit where they get killed.
