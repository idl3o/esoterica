## Description

The unity of subject and object is expressed by the concrete universal. Traditionally viewed as contradictory, it is shown to refer to self-consciousness. With reference to Georg Hegel's Science of Logic.

## Transcript

The dichotomy at the heart of metaphysics constitutes one of the oldest conflicts in the history of philosophy. This dialectic concerns the nature of substance, of that in which our perceptions are fundamentally grounded. Plato's distinction between forms and sensibles evolved from the Enlightenment period into the modern distinction between abstract and concrete objects respectively.

Today, abstract are demarcated from concrete when I count of their non-physicality, so that an abstract object is one with no location in space or time and is incapable of imparting change on the objective world. Concrete are conversely spatial and causally efficacious. Also implied in Plato's theory of forms is the distinction between universals and particulars.

Plato's commitment to the ideas or forms is founded in a recognition that such forms are universals that are instantiated in many particular things. Universals are accordingly qualities that objects have in common. Aristotle conversely believed that qualities depend on their instances and that there are therefore as many qualities as there are their instances in the world.

In other words, qualities are not universals, as Plato's opposed, but particulars, just like the objects of our external environment. Together, these two dichotomies can be represented as shown now, giving four classes of being. Here, the polarity between subjectively and objectively realized forms of being extends from the abstract universal to the concrete particular.

We are again interested in the lower right quadrant of this model in the concrete universal. The concrete universal refers to an object which is at once space or temple and something things have in common. It thus expresses that which is simultaneously contained in subjective experience and objective reality.

Insofar as concrete objects are deemed as both material and particular, and as universals are regarded as ideal and abstract. The concrete universal is often ignored as a possible object of our awareness. It is often regarded as a contradiction in terms. Nevertheless, there is a sense in which we can regard the concrete universal as an entity that surely does exist, if it refers to the universal in which all particular substance is grounded, or as what substance itself is basically.

Modern physics tells us that this substance is energy, but all we can say is that the concrete universal refers to the world as a whole. In the early 19th century, the German philosopher Gail Kegel developed a philosophy of the concrete universal as a universal of individuality. For while abstract universals tells us what individuals are like, the concrete universal tells us what individuals are in their own individual ways.

This would identify the concrete universal with the organic genus, which are united by ever higher genera. For example, this is a red rose, but it would still be a rose even if it was not red. That is because it's redness is abstract while it's roseness is concrete. All roses are individuals in so far as all roses are different, and there are no roses that do not express the universal of roseness.

The concrete universal is that which makes a thing what it is, regardless of what abstract properties it has or does not have. That is, individuals are united by the concrete universal, and the concrete universal is particularised as and thus established by individuals. The universal of individuality is the absolute individual for it participates in its instances, it cannot be wholly separated from them.

And what is absolute individuality? It is nothing other than self-consciousness itself, and just as the analytic a posterior rye is the knowledge of the self, the concrete universal is its being. Self-consciousness is not merely a concept, but a concrete and experiential reality. All that we call corporeal is corporeal in so far as it has representation within consciousness, and self-consciousness is not localised, particular times and spaces.

For all times and all spaces are recognised only in so far as they are fragments of the universal time and space, which is just self-consciousness. The concrete universal is the very possibility of understanding which has generated itself and made itself real. It is the idea of their being ideas, it is the absolute concept, which is the substance of all abstractions and which is therefore a concrete concept.

All things have their root in self-consciousness, and all self-consciousness has is its conception of what it is to be self-conscious of being self-conscious. Hegel writes the concept when it has developed into a concrete existence that is itself free, is none other than the eye or pure self-consciousness.

True eye have concepts, that is the terminate concepts, but the eye is the pure concept itself, the concept that has come into terminate existence. Much like the universal set in mathematical logic, the self-participation of the concrete universal is a consequence of the fact that all things participate in the concrete universal.

We experience a world filled with ideas and objects, but this world also contains ourselves experiencing, we are involved in our creation. All phenomena, whether abstract, particular or both, are known only by their presence within self-consciousness, and so the concrete universal is both an element of the world, and that within which the world is contained.

If this sounds paradoxical, that is because it is, reality is paradoxical at a fundamental level. The self is an element of and, positive by our reason, and our reason is simply the structure of the self, it is both within and without itself. The self-containing self can never be and never not be located, for it exists at all locations, and all locations exist within it.

It is the most obvious and most obscure aspect of our experience, for it is everywhere, and it is nowhere at once. It is an infinitesimal vanishing point which creates and is created by itself, and so an account of the self in terms of philosophy can only be given by taking philosophy as a whole to be precisely the self.

That is, the self is its own understanding of itself, and philosophy is the formalization of this understanding. It is on this ground that the philosophical science must be built, for the philosophical science must arise of the structure of reasons own, positing of itself. This act emerges through the possibility of analytic a posteriori knowledge, and its very being is the possibility of its own self-conception.

It is not something that exists prior to our conception of it. The concrete universal becomes what it is in time, and we, as the individuals of individuality, and through our ambition to divide the world by our concepts, our reflections of this primordial drive for division, so that we may look upon ourselves through another's eyes and recognize our own existence.

Individuality and self-knowledge must become substantiated by instances of their own nature, for the only individuality in sameness is the sameness of the individuality of individuals. The evolution of the phenomenal world is a separation of the object and subject from the self. All things are the awareness of an idea and its representation in time and space, and just like any other learning process, first arise the simple things and later comes complexity.

What exists at any point in time is precisely what the self needs to substantiate the context of its current state of understanding. This understanding has a rational aspect, which is represented by the mechanism of physical reality, and it has a meaningful aspect, which is represented by our personal, internal, mental worlds.

History is a creation whose purpose is to justify the present state of understanding, but it is not strictly the cause of the present, nor is the future its effect. Causality and law are artifacts of the perfect consistency of our power to create, and the present only evolves in accordance with natural law, because the perception of natural law is a necessary component of the development of our understanding.

The path to self-knowledge firstly leads away from oneself and into form, enrolling consciousness in a training camp for rational thought, which will eventually be capable of recognising the destination as back where it once started. When the intellect is capable of enough self-reference to recognise the nature of itself, then the duality between subject and objects shall begin to deconstruct.

This contraction of duality will manifest as a reframing of the intellect from the role of analysing and differentiating to one of synthesising and integrating. Our experience is that of a journey into the unknown and unmanifest to reclaim a lost relic and to bring it back into the light. Our reason expands in ignorance, drawing life into form as the desire for a union intensifies.

It contracts in understanding, relinquishing life as peace returns once more. This is a profound realisation, and one which is present in every moment we enjoy as conscious beings. When we are quiet, when we are still, we might recognise it, for it is encoded into our every breath, everything is written in the breath, to expand, to contract.

This is the nature of life.
