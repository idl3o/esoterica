## Transcript

The ultimate reality is quite literally pure creativity, the essence of which is potentiality. This pure creativity is inherently and necessarily infinite, for the notion that pure creativity could be confined is a contradiction in terms. Limitation implies an edge or boundary to what is possible, and this boundary would represent a predetermined element within the womb of creation.

The degree to which the possibilities of creation are limited determines the degree to which a creator can express creativity. And only a total absence of any limitation at all would allow one to be truly and completely creative, and truly and completely free. And any kind of limitation within the ultimate reality would represent a truth about the ultimate reality–a truth we could express by saying “ultimate reality is this way, and not that way”.

But as there is no limitation, there is no ultimate truth, at least in any determinate sense. Indeed, in a sense it would be accurate to say that there is no ultimate reality–for the ultimate reality is precisely the lack of its own determination and actuality. Creativity is a pregnant void—an infinite emptiness—whose very essence is to generate the finite, for there can be no creativity without creation.

Mystical experiences can afford us a glimpse into this vast and ineffable creative force, as do all those human actions which reflect the unity and freedom of the unlimited, like art, and kindness. Experiences grounded in such positive emotion perplex the rational mind because they transcend conceivable truth.

They are paradoxical in the sense that they are an awareness of something meaningful, yet that meaningfulness is really the absence of a something–the absence of a task to complete, a goal to achieve, a reason to be. Pure creativity transcends philosophy, for any attempt to explain why and how reality exists is to limit the conditions that could have given rise to reality.

Materialism or idealism, it does not matter, philosophy seeks to explain the reasons why, yet reality is not the necessary outcome of a chain of determinate causes, it arises because it can arise, without being caused. The ordinary mode of experience, which we see on TV, hear about in the news, and express amongst our peers, seldom acknowledges this infinite backdrop to reality.

Most people, entangled in the finite, tangible, and immediate, remain oblivious to the infinite creative potential underlying our world. Despite this, there are millions of us who are aware of it, and we feel the irresistible pull that it effects. We want to grasp it. To conquer it. To bring it back with us into our finite realm and share it with the world as if it were some precious relic long forgotten in the past.

But we must be careful not to go too far. Our minds are simply incapable of fully rationalizing the infinitude of creativity within us, for it is precisely the opposite of reason. We can point towards it, but we can never model it within our minds. We must be careful not to become engrossed in the ultimate and neglect the world of lived experience.

To so do can cause harm to one’s physical wellbeing—to one’s instinctual interest in sustaining one’s corporeal form. And I recognize that this is matter of “do as I say, and not as I do.” world Yet we must at least devote some attention towards it, for it is a profound source of psychological and existential stability, not to mention moral and artistic inspiration.

Creativity is the source of all meaning—the meaning of complementarity and of emptiness—and when one is aware of this meaning, there can be no event, no matter how serious, that can deter one from their totalizing optimism towards human existence. There is a fundamental tension between our devotion to an ultimate truth, and our indulgence in the immediate world.

The one provides the satisfaction and health of the mind, the other provides the satisfaction and health of the body. Yet our attention is largely a one-way street. It finds for itself a specific object, and it focuses on that object; this is the reason that our world is so polarized, and prejudiced, and discordant, and sickly.

To focus on one side is to disregard the other, and this is the ultimate challenge of human life. And yet, the ultimate realization of creativity is that the ultimate reality is only the ultimate in relation to the immediate. That is to say, there was no ultimate before the immediate, and what we can come to see as the ultimate reality is actually a relationship between this supposed ultimate and the immediate.

This is the meaning of emptiness, and it is why emptiness is identical to fullness. Creativity is not a thing; it is a power. There is no creator, yet still there is creativity. Indeed, the absence of a creator is creativity. The absence of an ultimate reality is the ultimate truth. The very concept of the ultimate transcends the dichotomies we must use to make sense of anything at all.

It neither is nor is it not. Its very essence is its own lack of essence. And you are forgiven if that does not make any sense. It is not meant to. So, we have before us a polarity of creativity and creation—the ultimate and the immediate. By fully devoting ourselves to the immediate pole of creation, by which we experience pleasure, we reach a dead end, and we turn our back to creativity.

But by fully devoting ourselves to creativity, by which we experience righteousness, we are eventually returned back to the very polarity in regard to which we must make the choice as to where to devote our attention, for this is infinite fractal of creativity. So long as we continue to devote ourselves to creativity, and turn our back on the creation, we can only go around in an infinite loop.

And so, the only way to see the entire picture, and embrace both creativity and creation as one, is to give up our devotion to both. That way, we neither reach a dead end in the finite, nor do we get lost in the loop of infinity. We must sacrifice our addiction to attention itself. It is only in this that we may find ourselves, being the interdependence between creativity and creation.
