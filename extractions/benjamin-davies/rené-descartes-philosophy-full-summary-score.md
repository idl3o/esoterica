## Description

Rene Descartes, celebrated for "cogito ergo sum," pioneered Cartesian dualism, which delves into the mind-body problem. His philosophical methodology, notably Cartesian skepticism and methodic doubt, critiqued the foundations of knowledge. Descartes' rationalism is exemplified by the Cartesian circle, and his arguments for the existence of God through the ontological argument. He also introduced the Cartesian coordinate system and analyzed perception through the Wax argument. Descartes' unique t

The method employed in this video is designed to measure a particular type of theoretic coherence and balance. It is not intended to show how true a given philosophy is, nor how good a philosopher is. The basic objective is the categorisation of different philosophical ideas, and the scoring system is introduced to add interest and increase accessibility, but alternative metrics of scoring are possible.

Please refer to the video displayed now for further information on this particular system or refer to my book for the underlying theory. Rene Descartes often referred to as the father of modern philosophy. Born in 1596 in Torraine, France, he operated during a period of radical intellectual transformation which was characterized by the scientific revolution and the gradual decline of Aristotelianism which had dominated medieval scholasticism.

Europe was grappling with the rise of new science. Religion was undergoing a major shift following the reformation, and the quest for a secure foundation of knowledge amidst skepticism was at the forefront of philosophy. Descartes was deeply influenced by the mathematical and scientific work of his predecessors, Galileo's application of mathematics to the study of the physical world, inspired Descartes' methodology as did the skepticism of Michael Demontane and the logic of the ancient Stoics.

Descartes sought to apply a mathematical rigor to philosophy in order to establish an indubitable basis for knowledge which famously led him to doubt everything that could possibly be doubted. Descartes' influence was vast and enduring. His ideas laid the groundwork for the rationalist tradition and the work of philosophers like Spinoza and Leibniz, his method of doubt and the Cogito, I think therefore I am, becoming foundational concepts in modern philosophy.

Descartes' approach to knowledge is based on rationalism, and rationalism is the belief that reason and logical thinking is the primary way we gain knowledge. He believed that for knowledge to be true, it must be clear and distinct, which means it must be easily understood, precise and undeniable. To find such true knowledge, Descartes started with a process he called radical doubt.

This means he questioned everything he believed, no matter how certain it seemed, to weed out any beliefs that could possibly be doubted. He did this to strip away all unreliable beliefs and get down to the basic undeniable truths. This process of systematic doubt led him to the one foundational truth he found undeniable, I think therefore I am.

He realized that while he could doubt the existence of everything around him, he couldn't doubt that he was thinking. Now, doubting is a form of thinking, so the very act of doubting confirmed to him that he must exist as a thinking thing. This insight is at the heart of Descartes' philosophy, showing that at least one thing is certain, the existence of the self as a thinking entity.

Descartes also contrasted the analytic and synthetic methods, determining that only the former was well suited for metaphysics. This method involves breaking down complex ideas into simpler components, and this is a process of discovery in so far as knowledge is uncovered by peeling away layers of confusion or doubt.

In contrast, the synthetic method, as used in geometrical demonstrations, starts with given definitions, postulates and axioms, to build up to more complex truths. Descartes criticised the synthetic method because it assumes the indubitability of its starting points which are not self evident, and are therefore neither clear nor distinct.

So while Descartes is a rationalist, his basic approach does not align with the synthetic a priori, as he emphasises the importance of achieving certainty through logical analysis. He did believe that the synthetic method was useful for demonstrating truths already discovered, but he did not believe it was useful for establishing certain knowledge.

Descartes' foundational beliefs also do not depend on synthetic a posteriori knowledge. While he sees the value of empirical observation, especially in scientific fields, he famously questioned how reliable our senses are when it comes to seeking absolute certainty. Descartes is often thought of as someone who wanted all sciences to follow the model of geometry and mathematics.

In this model, knowledge is built through logical deductions from self evident truths, rather than being based on observation and experimentation. However, this doesn't mean that Descartes dismissed the importance of experimentation. On the contrary, he contributed significantly to the development of mechanical physics, and this demonstrates his belief in the ability to gain objective knowledge about the world.

It is simply that empirical knowledge presupposes knowledge that is ultimately analytic in nature. It is also justified as a method only via a rationalist foundation, and as such, his trust in the synthetic a posteriori does not support itself, and so we cannot categorise him in this class. Descartes believed that using reason and logical deduction is the primary way we arrive at true knowledge, so he has a clear connection to the analytic a priori.

His methodological skepticism exemplifies this approach using deductive reasoning to build a system from indubitable principles. His admiration for the certainty of mathematical knowledge influenced this approach, and he aimed for similar clarity in philosophical inquiry. This methodology is principally analytic, focusing on decomposing complex issues before reconstructing them again to form a coherent whole with the synthetic method.

While it can easily be argued that his foundational truths, the existence of the self, God and the external world, are in fact synthetic a priori, Descartes believed that he had reached them through a purely logical method of analysis. However, there is another point of contention here. The cogito, I think therefore I am, well certainly intended as an analytic truth, also involves an empirical act, the experience of thinking.

This means that even though the conclusion, I am a thinking thing, is reached through deduction and analysis. The starting point, the act of doubting or thinking, is based on one's personal experience. Therefore, while Descartes does indeed highly value deduction and the analysis of ideas, his foundational insight cannot be considered purely analytic a priori, insofar as it is derived from such an empirical act.

So Descartes cogito embodies an experience of self-awareness that is both logical and rooted in personal experience. However, describing this self-awareness as analytic a posteriori is not a universal opinion in philosophy, though there are notable philosophers like Stephen Palmquist who feel that the relevance of the acts of doubting and believing in the cogito is precisely that they are experienced.

Thus, while the cogito arises from an internal experience, I feel that it is most accurately seen as an example of analytic a posteriori knowledge, and so Descartes can also be thought of as having a connection to superjectivism. So in summary, Descartes is primarily a subjectivist, due to his logical method of analysis, yet the foundation of his system is superjectivist, in his realization of the self's existence.

Descartes' epistemology is therefore a hybrid of synthetic subjectivism and superjectivism. Descartes' ontology is famously dualistic, meaning he believes in two fundamentally different types of substance, res cogitons, or thinking substance, and res extensor, or extended substance. Descartes' cogitons refers to the mind or soul, characterized by its ability to think and its lack of physical extension, meaning it doesn't take up space.

Res extensor refers to the physical world, which is defined by its occupation of space and its adherence to mechanical laws. Now, Descartes' ontology features both attributes, which are the essential qualities of a substance and modes, which are the specific properties of a substance. And he seems to assert that both of these should be thought of as abstract particulars.

So abstract qualities, like shapes, are considered unique to their particular instances, rather than being universal properties shared by multiple substances. Descartes also does consider concrete particulars as a fundamental category of reality, despite the fact that the existence of particular physical objects is not as epistemically secure as the existence of the thinking self.

For Descartes' universals are general attributes, but these are reducible to modes of thinking or as Descartes puts it to ideas in our finite minds. As such, despite his substance dualism, it appears that Descartes did not believe in abstract universals in any platonic sense. He held a conceptualist perspective where universals are general ideas in the mind, which arise from the fact that we use the same ideas for thinking about similar things.

Using his criterion of clear and distinct ideas, Descartes was able to certify beyond doubt his belief in a God that would not deceive him. It was because it was certain that God would not deceive him that Descartes could then also certify as certain his belief in the existence of the world outside his mind.

So insofar as God can be considered as a concrete universal, Descartes' ontology really comprises three basic substances rather than two, God, mind, and matter. Thus, Descartes aligns most closely with a hybrid of abjectivism, objectivism, and superjectivism. And in matter are two distinct kinds of substances that interact with each other, but all quality is our particular.

Hello guys, sorry to disturb you of viewing, but I need to quickly tell you something. My goal has always been to further our understanding of reality, so that we can begin to justify at the most basic structures of society are more interconnected and charitable outlook on our relation to the world and others.

I believe that achieving this goal is the most important challenge facing humanity as it heads to the future, and I recognize that it is not a goal that any of us can achieve on our own. I've been focused on this goal for over ten years now, and regrettably, a time has come where my obsession has become unsustainable, I've hit a wall.

With some apprehension, therefore, I've decided to allow others the opportunity to facilitate my goal, because I really don't think I should stop, and because I know what I can achieve. If you are in a position to contribute to my cause, I've now enabled YouTube memberships, which you can access via the join button below, or you can use one of the more favourable and direct options like Patreon, which will be linked in the description.

Thank you so much if you do decide to support myself, but more importantly, para-philosophy. Your help will go a long way. Now back to the video. Descartes' approach to axiology is naturally extended from his rationalist philosophy, which places reason as the foremost means of acquiring knowledge. He held a belief in innate ideas, concepts inherent to the mind, and is sometimes described as a virtue ethicist, which is a branch of ethics focused on the importance of character.

According to Descartes, true happiness and the highest satisfaction of the mind come from living a virtuous life, and among the various virtues we can practice, he was particularly concerned with generosity, which is also involved in the management of one's passions. Descartes advocated for the development of good habits in both thought and action, as essential for leading a virtuous life.

He introduced the idea of formulating a provisional moral code, a set of guidelines for conduct, which are intended to serve as a temporary ethical framework while one pursues absolute certainty and knowledge. Therefore, while we may not know what is truly good, it is still important that humans live ethically.

And for Descartes, virtue encompasses more than just moral behaviour. It also includes an intellectual component wherein the pursuit of knowledge, metaphysics, and natural philosophy is vital to the good life. Descartes' approach to virtue ethics can be interpreted as aligning with moral objectivism. This is because he posits the existence of a concept of virtue and moral truth that stands independent of individual opinions and feelings.

However, Descartes' emphasis on the variety of virtues, along with the significant role he assigns to reason in ethical deliberation, could be interpreted as resonating with value pluralism, whereby there are multiple sometimes conflicting virtues or principles that are all inherently valuable. Indeed, Descartes' suggestion that there are many virtues to develop, as well as the idea of his provisional moral code imply an acknowledgement of the complexity of moral life and flexibility in moral judgement.

Of course, it must be noted that Descartes does not explicitly advocate for value pluralism and he's much more concerned with the pursuit of certain knowledge and therefore remains silent where certain knowledge has not been attained or is not possible. So while we can tentatively assume his ethics to be connected to axiological objectivism, this is merely a best guess.

He does not appear to be a subjective relativist in ethics due to his commitment to the power of reason as a pathway to discovering objective truths, including in the realm of morality and his recognition of the provisional status of moral judgments before achieving certain knowledge implies that he may not fully embrace moral absolutism, at least in the practical application of ethics, so he cannot categorize him as an objective absolutist in ethics.

And by extension, this means that we also cannot categorize him as a subjective absolutist or ideal observer theorist due to his view of the virtues of character being objective realities that can be discovered through the correct use of reason. So, in summary, Descartes' most likely alignment is with axiological objectivism and value pluralism.

His rationalistic approach implies the existence of objective moral truths and his virtue ethics indicates a recognition of the complexity and plurality of moral principles. Descartes' political perspective is not as explicitly developed as his other contributions but can be inferred to some degree from his writings.

His approach appears to have been conservative, emphasizing the importance of stability and the preservation of existing social and political institutions. This conservative stance is reflected in his general avoidance of direct engagement with the political controversies of his time, as well as his preference for maintaining the status quo.

His avoidance of advocating for political change or revolution may have stemmed from his broader philosophical commitment to clear and distinct ideas, leading him to favour a cautious approach to social and political matters as well. His political opinions, to the extent they can be discerned, suggest a respect for traditional authority and escepticism towards efforts to radically transform the established order.

So, Descartes believed in the value of established traditions and authorities, both secular and sacred, which indicates a respect for a certain level of authority and hierarchy in society. Descartes' reluctance to engage in the reform of public affairs, which he considered complex and risky, further supports the view that he leaned towards a form of authoritarian individualism.

He seemed to believe that attempting to correct societal defects through radical change could lead to instability, preferring instead trusting custom and tradition to gradually improve the fabric of society. Descartes' emphasis on individual reason could have been used in support of the value of individual liberty, but there's no evidence that he was a political libertarian, so he cannot be categorised as a libertarian individualist.

His disinterest in political reform and acceptance of existing societal structures implies that he did not place the value of the collective over that of the individual, and so he cannot be categorised as an authoritarian collectivist. And there's nothing really at all in Descartes that suggests anything like libertarian collectivism so he cannot be placed there either.

So in summary, Descartes aligns most closely with a conservative approach to politics, which could be seen as a form of political objectivism due to his acceptance of established authorities and his skepticism towards political reform. However, again, it's important to note that political theory was not a primary focus of Descartes' work, and his alignment with any of the four classes is more a matter of inference from his scattered remarks.

In conclusion then, Descartes appears to be an epistemological subjectivist but with a considerable element of superjectivism. He is an ontological objectivist, objectivist, and superjectivist. He is an axiological objectivist, and he is a political objectivist. We can thus award him a consistency score of 16.5 out of 24 or 69 percent, and a neutrality score of 14.5 out of 24 or 60 percent.

From total then, his score is 31 out of 48 or 65 percent, and for this he receives the grade of B minus.
