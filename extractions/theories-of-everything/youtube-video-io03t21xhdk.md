My idea is a crazy idea, and I admit it's a crazy idea, but you need something crazy because the conventional ideas don't work, and I think people just sort of go with the crowd. I'm just not persuaded by going with the crowd if it doesn't make sense. I don't believe a word of it. The big bang was not the beginning.

The same as quantum mechanics. No, there's a huge thing missing. It's extremely accurate. You could say it's incomplete. Schrodinger and Einstein were much more polite. That is said, well, quantum mechanics is incomplete. So I'd suggest, oh, there's a little detail. Oh, change the sound here. I don't mean that.

It's a big thing that's missing. Standard cosmology says the big bang was the beginning. Penrose says that's dead wrong. His conformal cyclic cosmology makes each big bang the conformal continuation of a previous Eon's remote future. Why? Because mass becomes irrelevant. Twice, in fact, for different reasons.

At the big bang, there's extreme temperature, and in the remote future, there's only massless photons and scaling of direct particles. No mass means no scale. So conformal geometry. This lets the remote future match a stretched out big bang. And this explains why our origin is smooth, while black holes are tumultuous.

Penrose argues inflation doesn't explain this, but his model does. He further insists that quantum mechanics is wrong, not just incomplete. On this channel, I interview researchers on theories of reality with rigor and depth, and I've been blessed to speak to Roger Penrose four times. Once for the Institute for Arts and Ideas, once in a two-hour podcast last year in Oxford's Math Institute, today for another two-hour session that you're about to see, and soon again on this channel in a couple weeks, with his collaborator, Professor Yvette Fuentes, on a groundbreaking new unannounced experiment.

So subscribe for that. Enjoy this episode with Sir Roger Penrose. Professor, what is something that most physicists believe that you think is completely wrong? Well, there are several things I venture. I think probably the most blatant one is the cosmology's model I have. You see most people who believe, who normal cosmologists these days, believe that the universe began with the big bang, and there was an early phase called inflation, and this phase was supposed to have smoothed the universe out.

I never believe that, it doesn't make sense, because why does it work in one direction and not in the other direction? I mean, you get crazy singularities in black holes, which are not automatically smoothed out by time reversed inflation. It doesn't, it's, okay, most cosmologists believe in inflation.

I don't believe a word of it, but this is just part of the story. You see the story which I have is that the big bang was not the beginning, that the universe goes through cycles. The cycles start with each one starts with its own big bang. Terminates with a remote future. You see, this is the thing you have to understand is that the scheme, but at both ends, the conformal structure of space time is the relevant thing.

conformal structure to give an idea, it's useful to think of these Escher pictures with infinity, see angels and devils, and they cry out along this circle boundary, which represents infinity, and this is a conformal representation. Now, the same thing applies, I claim, to the universe as a whole, and our remote future is a situation.

I'm arguing that there are two times, actually, like, each of these times mass becomes irrelevant. One of them is at the big bang, mass becomes irrelevant, because the temperature gets so high that the particles move around so fast that the mass contribution becomes trivial. I mean, the main contribution is the kinetic motion, and the actual rest mass of the particles becomes less and less important to the closer you get to the big bang as you go earlier.

So, that's a situation in which mass becomes irrelevant at the beginning, and another place where mass becomes irrelevant to a quite different reason is in the very remote future, and then I won't go into the reason in detail. That's sort of shifted for my early arguments, but the massive particles, the mass term scales in such a way that it becomes irrelevant in the remote future.

It's certainly direct particles, and the direct particles will be the main particles, apart from photons, photons are already massless. The other particles mainly will be direct particles, electrons, positrons, maybe protons, but maybe they're decay, doesn't matter which, they're still direct particles, and they will, if you write them in the right way, you can see that this scale out, and so they become effectively massless in the remote future.

So, those two ends, the mass disappears. Now, when you don't have any mass, you don't have any scale. The geometry is really what I call conformals geometry. Well, it's not what I call it, it is conformals geometry, and the conformals geometry means we're like those Escher pictures, you preserve angles, the angles are clearly defined, and make sense, and are affected by getting close to the edge of the picture, whereas the sizes are changed.

So conformals geometry is the geometry of angles, as you like. In space time, it's the geometry of the light cones, so you have the null cones, I should say, the null cone gives you nine out of ten components of the metric, the tenth component really is the scaling of the whole thing, and that is given by the mass.

The scaling of the mass comes from the two most famous formulas, 20th century physics, one of them is e equals mc squared, and the other is e equals h nu, hf, if you like, due to plank. So the Einstein, e equals mc squared, and the max plank, e equals hf, or h nu, puts two together, and that tells you that frequency and mass are equivalent.

You see the energy is running in the cell, so frequency and mass are equivalent, so that mass is what gives you the scale, so term is a frequency. You see, if you don't have any mass, you don't have the notion of frequency, then you don't have scale, so you have conformal geometry, and the two places you don't have mass, I argue, is in the remote future, because the direct particles are all left and they scale away, and the big bang, where you have energy so great that the mass becomes irrelevant.

So for quite different reasons, but then the argument is that then a remote future from a conformal perspective is very like a stretched out big bang, and the reason for this perspective is that the big bang is extraordinarily special in the sense that the gravitational degrees of freedom are not activated, and some for some reason, and this isn't explained by inflation, it's not explained by any conventional cosmology.

However, it is explained, if you say, that the big bang is a conformal continuation of the remote future, because you find that the scale, the gravitational degrees of freedom, scale away, it's a little bit of a subtle question, because the gravity has two different scaleings, one of them goes away, and the other one stays with you, and enables gravitational signals to get through from one side to the other.

But anyway, that's a scheme, which I think there's a lot of evidence for, but people pay very little attention to it, and certainly it's not the majority of you is to have a big bang in inflation and all that stuff. That's perhaps the main example, where I hold a different view from most people. Another place where I hold a different view I think has to do with the collapse of the wave function, which I believe is a very important phenomenon, which when you see there's no common view on that one, I think, you see, with the cosmology, there is a common view that the big bang was the beginning, and for some reason, trying to be argued that inflation was the reason, but it doesn't really work, that the uniformity of the big bang, which distinguishes it from the incredible complication that you expect for singularities in black holes.

I mean, they're so utterly different in nature, so you need some explanation for that. I mean, the other element has to do with the collapse of the wave function. But there, there isn't really a common view. I think there's this hell by most physicists. I'm not sure what most physicists think. They usually sweep the problem under the carpet, I think, as far as I can make out, that recognizing is a serious problem.

So two of the other problems that inflation solves, one is flatness that you mentioned, the two of the other ones are the uniformity of the CMB, so the horizon problem. But the fact that you don't have a gravitational degrees of freedom, I mean, people don't sort of recognize that very well. I don't know what you see, I found it very puzzling, because the expectation inside black holes, of course we don't know what goes on inside black holes, but the expectation from independent calculations from a Russian group, Balinsky Lipschitz and Kalatnikov and Charlie Misner in Princeton.

And they have pictures of the complicated situation that you get as you get close to the singularity, and it's very complicated. You find curvatures go wild in different directions and one direction takes over and then another one and it's very complicated. Nothing like the Big Bang. I don't think people think about the problem really.

It's not that they have a different view from me. They have a different view, but they actually don't face up to the real problem. They have this belief somehow that inflation solves the problem, which is in my view completely wrong. Where does that belief come from? The fact that you have, you don't have this kind of singularity in the Big Bang.

And so the belief has to come from somewhere. And so the inflationary point of view seems to be that's all they can think of, I suppose. I don't know. I mean, it's very commonly believed. The inflation is part of standard cosmology. I was speaking to, it was either Leonard Saskin or Neil deGrasse Tyson, and I was asking one of those two, I believe is one of those two.

What is it that you disagree with your colleagues about? And then he thought and said, if I disagreed strongly with my colleagues about it, then I probably shouldn't be thinking it because something that they believe in the wisdom of the crowds, they believe that they're the ones that are most likely incorrect if everyone else believes something different.

How is it that you can maintain this level of maybe, maybe belief is not the correct word conviction and credence in your own ideas despite being criticized by colleagues? How do you psychologically deal with that? Just if the arguments are wrong. I mean, I don't see any good arguments against my point of view.

I mean, the thing about the cosmology is that it's a crazy idea. My idea is a crazy idea, and I admit it's a crazy idea. But you need something crazy because the conventional ideas don't work. And I think people just sort of go with the crowd. I'm just not persuaded by going with the crowd. It doesn't seem to me.

I mean, lots of things I don't know anything about. And then I say, I'll trust the crowd because I haven't got any views on my own. I would say particle physics is a good example. I don't have any particular views on my own. So I'm quite prepared to believe what the most people think about particle physics is probably on the whole correct.

I don't know. I don't have an opposing view on that. So have you always been like that? I don't think my own views have been worked out enough to have a strong opposing view to what other people might think. I mean, it goes back, I suppose, to the singularity theorem I proved, which eventually got a Nobel Prize, which was the...

You see, that was... It was at a time when people were very puzzled because of the quasars. And they found these very bright objects, very distant objects, and people weren't even quite sure how far away they were. They weren't sure that the redshift you saw was actually a cosmological redshift, or might it be some gravitational redshift or something like that.

There was a lot of puzzlement about it. So it was at a time when there was a lot of confusion, I think, about what was going on. And I became interested in this without holding a particular view of my own. And I did learn about the Oppenheimer Snyder collapse picture of a collapsing cloud of dust, in fact it was.

And this reached the singularity at the end. And this was well known to people, but nobody trusted it for the very good reason, but this assumes exact spherical symmetric symmetry. So that you might think that if it's not symmetrical, it would get more and more complicated as it collapses, and then it might swoosh swirl around and come swishing out again.

So I think that was the common view at the time, that although Oppenheimer Snyder was well known, it didn't seem to represent reality in people's view, which was a reasonable point of view, I think. And I didn't know what the answer was. There had been a paper at the time written by Lyftes and Kalatnikov, two Russians, and they seemed to have proved that in the general case you would not get singularities.

And I looked at the paper, I didn't sort of go into it very hard, I thought the techniques they were using were not likely to be trustworthy. I didn't see the mistake in the paper. There was a serious error in the paper, which was later found by Balinsky, I think, who corrected the mistake and joined the other group, and the later paper came to the opposite conclusion that he singularities were generic, but they did come about like, but that was not the view at the time.

The view at the time was that Lyftes and Kalatnikov had shown that singularities didn't occur in general, and therefore the Oppenheimer Slyther collapse, you'd have swirled around, maybe it'd come swishing out again. I began to worry about this problem, and I wasn't sure I believed Lyftes and Kalatnikov, I didn't take them very seriously, probably not for a good reason, that's mainly I hadn't looked at the paper thoroughly enough.

I said they did not see the error in the paper, that was seen by Balinsky later on, I think. However, I did think about whether the distribution was likely to be correct or not, and came to the view that probably singularities were generic. I'm not quite sure why I think, so it came to that view. I had been thinking about related problems, and I probably vaguely formed that view, but I didn't have an argument for it, and I told this story many times, but I was, I've all Robinson, who was a very good talker.

He wrote his papers by talking, and somebody else would co-authors them. He would never write them himself, but then he was, he talked very elegantly, and he was talking to me, I was on my way to my job at Buckback College, and I remember we were walking along the street, and then there was a side street, we had to cross the road, and as we crossed the road, the conversation stopped, and when there's got the other side of the road, his conversation started again, and then when he left, I was left with a strange feeling of elation.

Why do I feel elated, I thought, I can't think. So I began to take all the things that happened to me, what happened to Brexit? No, nothing to do with that. Walking the woods to get to the bus stop, no, no, that can't have been it. The bus tripped, no, the same, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then it's, oh, it was running across the road, I had an idea, that was it.

And so I reconstructed what that idea was, which I think was, I'm never quite got this straight, but I'm pretty sure it was the idea of the trapped surface. You have to have some criterion, which is a generic criterion, so it doesn't assume that you have symmetry or anything like that. It just tells you that the collapse had gone to irreversible place, and this with you have a surface, and you look at the boundary of the future, when you look at the future region of that thing, and it has converging lines on it, and I knew enough about some of these things to show that this would lead you to a contradiction, and then there must be something wrong, and that singularity is where generic.

I've been using Claude for my research and podcast prep, and it's fundamentally different from other AI tools. What makes it stand out is how it thinks with you, rather than just answering questions. Claude was built by Anthropic and founded by Dario Moldey, former VP of research at OpenAI, as a public benefit corporation focused on AI safety.

The latest models are Claude Sonnet 4.5, that went particularly great by the way. It just got released a few weeks ago, and it balances intelligence with speed perfectly, especially great for coding. Then there's of course Claude Opus 4.1. These, in my opinion, and by some objective measures are the world's best coding models.

Here's what I use on a daily basis. Firstly, I have the Claude Max Plan, and I use Sonnet 4.5 to help build tools for research for this podcast. I build little applets that allow me to interact with it to better prepare for guests. I actually use their artifacts feature live during this podcast with Eva Miranda.

I also use it at the beginning of the Stephen Wolfram podcast to generate cellular automata. For technical work, there's Claude code, which is a command line tool that lives in your terminal and edits files. It handles Git operations. It understands your entire code base. It understands my work context. So my previous Python script, and it's just, it's a joy to use of all the CLI agents.

This one, Claude code is by far the one that I use the most and enjoy the most. Get 50% off Claude Pro, including access to Claude code at Claude.ai slash theories of everything. That's all lower case. Again, that's Claude.ai slash theories of everything for 50% off. The economist covers math, physics, philosophy, and AI in a manner that shows how different countries perceive developments and how they impact markets.

They recently published a piece on China's new neutrino detector. They cover extending life via mitochondrial transplants, creating an entirely new field of medicine. But it's also not just science. They analyze culture. They analyze finance, economics, business, international affairs across every region, and particularly liking their new insider feature.

It was just launched this month. It gives you, it gives me a front row access to the economist's internal editorial debates, where senior editors argue through the news with world leaders and policymakers in twice weekly long format shows, basically an extremely high quality podcast. Whether it's scientific innovation or shifting global politics, the economist provides comprehensive coverage beyond headlines as a toll listener.

And then I gave a talk about this. The thinking about this. Yes, that's right. I give a talk about this at King's College London.

And the movie according to the movie Stephen Hawking was there being in spa and sparks coming out of his head or something. He wasn't there, but it's not quite so bad as that because I did to give a repeat talk. This was a King's College London. I gave this talk. I gave a repeat talk in Cambridge. She Dennis Sharma had heard about my talk and asked me to give another talk in Cambridge.

So I gave a repeat. And Stephen Hawking was present at that talk. And I talked to him afterwards. And it mainly it was the talk afterwards, which I had to him and George Ellis. And I think Brandon Carson, at least for some of this discussion, and which I described the details of the proof that I had. And this Stephen then picked up on some of these ideas and generalised them to so to apply to the big bang and things like that.

And then we collaborated on a paper, which was very general arguments. Curiously enough, it didn't quite include my original theorem. So the original theorem was not a corollary of what we did in that my general paper. I didn't think now because we had a different condition on the energy condition was stronger.

We were talking off air about what is it that you're most misunderstood about? I would think the consciousness thing probably. The trouble is that's a murky subject. And probably I'm not sure I should have got into it at all. It's a good question. I think I'm glad I did. But it came about mainly from talks.

You see, this was one of the three courses I went which were nothing to do when I was a graduate student in Cambridge. And I went to three courses that were nothing to do with my subject. One was by Herman Bondy on general relativity. One was by Paul Dirac on quantum mechanics beginning through and Tommy clearly.

And the third one was about by a man called Steen on mathematical logic. And I learnt about the girdle theorems. And I found it absolutely stunning because I had sort of vaguely heard that girdle theorem showed that there were things in mathematics you couldn't prove. I didn't like the idea very much. But then when I heard what it actually said, I found this stunning because what it says, you make a sentence and this sentence says, you have to clever to make it do it.

But you make this sentence say, in effect, I am not provable by those rules. And that's what it says. So you say, well, maybe it's false. If it's false, it is provable by the rules. And therefore it's true. And not provable by the rules. Amazing. So how do you make it do that? Well, that's the trick of course.

But what I found remarkable is that how do you know it's true? You know it's true not because of the rules that you're using because you believe that those rules only give you truths. And what's the point of using these rules as methods of proof if you don't trust the rules? Why is it proof anyway? Why is it something that you believe to be true?

Only because you trust the rules. But if you trust the rules, then you can prove this other statement which is based on your beliefs that the rules only give you truths. But you can't obtain that using the rules. I'm telling you, it wouldn't be much good if you didn't use the rules because you have to know that the rules only give you truths in order to trust the conclusion.

So you have to understand why the rules only give you truths. So then I've got to think, well, what does understanding mean? What are you doing? Well, it seems to me, whatever it is, it seems to involve consciousness. I mean, the very term understanding, you wouldn't really say an entity understands something unless it's aware of it.

That's normal usage of the language. So to understand something, you have to be aware of it. So for some reason, the awareness of things gives you something beyond what you could achieve with computers. So that is a view which I felt held then and still hold, which is more relevant than ever now, of course, because people talk about AI, which is already a misnomer as far as I'm concerned.

It's not artificial intelligence. It may be artificial cleverness or something because it doesn't involve any understanding. You're just following the rules. And the argument that I've convinced myself learning from Mr. Steen about the mathematical logic was to say that the understanding of why the rules work is something which is not a computational thing.

What is it if it's not computational? Well, it's something to do with consciousness. Now, you see, I don't know anything about it. I wrote my book, The Emperor's New Mind, to try and express this point of view. And I learned a bit of neurophysiology, thinking that if I learned enough neurophysiology, I would find out somewhere what it is that you should form the view.

Yes, I have to backtrack a little bit. I formed the view thinking of all the laws of physics. You see, I'm a physicist. I believe whatever is going on in my heads is following the laws of physics. But what are the laws of physics? Well, the laws of physics, Newtonian mechanics does pretty well, but then you have to go further than that.

You have to have Maxwell's equations. You have to talk about special relativity, general relativity and quantum mechanics. Well, but all these things, although there's a little bit of what I call it a incompleteness in the argument, you see, all these theories depend on the continuum. And it might, there could be a catch there that something is not based on the continuum.

But the continuum seems to be how you can approximate the continuum and do and calculate very accurately. Even with that time, there weren't good calculations on general relativity, but I realized that was still a computational problem. And nowadays, people do great things with calculators on computing what happens with black holes spiraling into each other and things like that, which is pretty impressive.

So sure, that's things you could put on a computer. General relativity, as well as Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell's equations, all these things, you can put on a computer. Quantum mechanics, well, the Schrodinger equation, that's you can put that on a computer, maybe lots of variables you have to worry about and so on and so forth, but still a store, the same sort of thing.

How about the collapse of the wave function? Well, that seemed to be like the gap that maybe is where one needs a gap in this whole discussion and that's the only gap that I know of. It could be there's something else, of course, that we don't know in physics, but that seems to be an important gap and collapse of the wave function.

You see, many people, including Vigna, you see, I remember talking to Vigna when I was in Princeton, and I remember I had dinner with him and I was discussing this question with him because one of the views attributed to Vigna was that it's a conscious being observing the quantum system which collapses the wave function.

So it requires consciousness to make the collapse work. I talked to him a bit and he was not so dogmatic because people tend to think about this. He said that was a view that he played with and thought it was a possibility. I didn't think it was a tall likely for all sorts of reasons. It seems to me that I had this argument about a distant planet which is an Earth-like planet and the weather on that planet, there's no life, it just never got started and there's no butterfly to flap its wings and cause the weather to do this or that.

It's just a quantum mixture of all the different weatheres it could possibly have and there's no conscious observer to look at it. So it's just a quantum superposition of all these different alternatives. So the Space Pro which travels out takes a photograph of all this superposition of all these different weatheres and when it gets back to Earth or close to Earth it sends a signal to the Earth and says this is the photograph I've just taken and somebody sitting in there looking at a screen sees this superposition of weatheres.

First time a conscious being has seen it, suddenly it becomes one weather doesn't make any sense. So that's not what I believe. It's not that consciousness causes the collapse of the wave function. My view is almost the opposite. It's that whatever consciousness is it depends on the collapse of the wave function but there is the only thing which I could see which was not obviously computable.

Okay the way we do it is we just introduce a randomness but that I would argue isn't approximation but there is something going on which is not just explained by randomness but it doesn't I don't have a solution to that question but it did sort of it was my entry into the consciousness discussion and I mean I wrote my book The Empress New Mind to try and explain this point of view.

I had no answer. I remember getting to the end thinking I would learn about the Hodgkin Huxley, no of transmissions and I would learn but enough about that to see what the answer might be. No I didn't. So I just sort of tapered off at the end with something I didn't really believe and that was the end of the book but later on I learned from Stuart Hammarroth about microtubules which I thought were much more likely.

Something in microtubules could easily be more likely but the subject is not something it involves biology I don't understand about biology. I can't remember the names that people keep using and they talk about different chemical process processes or beyond me so it's not something that I feel I could develop thinking in so that's I mean I did have lots of discussions with people but the discussion sort of went off and different directions and not anything which I can really contribute to.

I think there's interesting aspects about the collapse of the wave function which most of which I didn't know at the time but thinking about later there's something extremely puzzling about how it works with regard to time and this puzzlement could easily have relevance to conscious perception and things like this.

So I think there's there's some there's a story there which is worth exploring but it's not really an area which I I don't I can never remember the names that people talk of the chemicals which are involved and so on and it's not a kind of thing I can do so how happy for other people to follow these lines up except I don't think they've got very close as yet.

I don't know it's quite possible that this is not my idea because I can't really contribute but one thing I would worry about is you have the cerebrum and the cerebellum underneath the cerebellum is organized much more in the way that if you're a computer scientist you would organize it the left hand part controls the left hand the left all the left side of the body the right hand part with the right hand side of the body there's none of this crazy crossing over and all that stuff that cerebrum is involved with it's much more organized like a computer it's completely unconscious it's it's just like a computer maybe but the thing that impressed me a little bit about what Stuart Hameroff was doing later on is that he considers that this main relevant structures in the brain have to do with things called pyramidal cells and that's the first time I've heard about certain types of cell which are not found in the cerebellum everything else you see is the same kinds of cells and so on so what but these cells an occupy a particular location in the brain and Stuart seems to think that they are very important with regard to consciousness I can't make any comment there because it's not my area but I do find that particular suggestion is quite plausible that's all I can say now if you're a physicalist and you believe that the collapse of the wave function somehow produces consciousness then I don't see that as inconsistent with the computer being conscious because a computer is a physical system after all well no it would have to be honest and you would have to make use of it in some way you see it's I mean it's physical in the sense that the collapse of the wave functions part of physics it's not to do with an observer looking at it as I was saying earlier it has to do with the system getting too big in some sense and that's another line of thinking which I've developed to some extent independently I had an argument which I put forward some I around about the turn of the century I can't remember exactly when and it came up this argument produced a lifetime for a superposition so if you have a body take this cup to get about the coffee in it take this cup and imagine it's in superposition of being here and here well I can tell you that that will have a lifetime of becoming one or the other what is that lifetime well I work out if I take two copies of the cup right on top of each other I move one of them away from the other I ask how much energy that would cost me if I consider only gravity to the gravitational force between the particles as I move this away it's tiny but still huge in another respect that energy is a fundamental uncertainty it was reciprocal gives you the lifetime so the lifetime for this cup would be absolutely instantaneous if it's a molecule maybe not maybe take a long time if it's a big enough molecule maybe the collapse would happen quite quickly depends how big it is but that calculation tells you the lifetime I should say that that lifetime was independently discovered independently about two years before me by Dioci so that you can call it the Dioci lifetime by someone's call it that however his scheme is in a way different from mine and there was you still have an argument for a lifetime but it has other implications in his scheme which have been refuted there was an experiment done a few years ago about three or four years ago I can't remember now in a mountain because his point of view would predict that the collapsing is happening all the time and this gives you an effective heating and so the system would gradually heat up there would be a slight spontaneous heating and that heating is measured not to take place so some people say this disproves this penrose theory but it's not the penrose theory because my scheme does not involve the heating it would be a nuisance because I think it would cause real problems with cosmology you have neutron stars would probably would already be heating up spontaneously in a way that they don't so I don't believe that but in order to avoid the heating problem you have to have something else which is very curious and this curious thing depends on certain things being retro causal as though the cause goes back into the past but you can only make sense of this if you have what I call two kinds of reality one is classical reality and the other is quantum reality and classical reality well the cup here has classical reality I can say hello cup what is your shape and you say well I've got a more or less a circle up there and I have this particular curve there and actually symmetric apart from the handle so on you see that's classical reality I can ask it what its shape is quantum reality is better described by say the spin of an electron the spin of electron the spin state could be in any direction in space but it's the superposition quantum superposition only two directions if you want to ask it you say you see Einstein had a criterion so I think people were worrying about whether the quantum state was real or not when I say real I don't mean real in the mathematical sense as opposed to complex because it's complex numbers but I mean real is it physically real and Einstein had the following criteria he says if you have a state that you can perform a measurement on the state such that it gives you the answer yes you've got the right right answer yes with certainty that gives it a reality without disturbing the system that's right if you can make a measurement without the system to say are you like a spin half particle say is your spin in that direction and if you got it right it will say yes with certainty that's Einstein's criteria for the reality I'm slightly changing the terminology that is in my mind the criterion for quantum reality it's you can't say hello particle which way are you spinning or you can say that but it won't tell you it looks at you blankly it says I don't answer questions like that suggests the direction you see then you can suggest the direction if you got it right it will say yes you got it right if you've got it wrong it may say yes it may say no with various probabilities depending on where if you've got it completely wrong opposite right it will say no with certainty so Einstein's criteria and is satisfied that you can't ask the particle which way it's spinning that's quantum reality so you have to distinguish between the quantum and classical realities and the quantum reality has very curious cause cause or behavior it looks as though it goes past into the past and things like that so you have to be very careful about it that it doesn't give you a causal anomaly somehow you could predict the suit predict the past or something the contradict so it doesn't do that because there's only quantum reality but it's a curious kind of situation which I have written about but not probably sufficiently detailed and I'm thinking about writing a paper which would explain this more completely it's actually in my in my book fashion faith and fantasy so it's in the book but perhaps it needs a little bit more sharpening up yeah do you see this quantum and classical reality as completely distinct because most of the time people think of the classical world as the limit of large n or large amounts of quantum systems I mean you can have a quantum system which has a huge spin and that's been still quantum quantum reality it's not going to give you a classical answer it just goes to spin this large so the fact that your state involves many degrees of freedom what do you mean by large you see is it mean lots of degrees of freedom are included in which case I don't think that's the answer the answer has to do more with mass displacement and then yeah it's been on them moving the glass and so on so the classical reality it's not a fully worked out scheme I don't know the answer to most of these questions but all I would say is that I think this criterion for collapse for a body into locations is a fairly clear cut formula I said the D or she time scale for collapse but it's not just because the system is big in the sense of having many degrees of freedom that's what one means my big guess of course big in the sense of mass displacement yes that probably is true but then you see that's let me put it like this it depends on combining with general relativity now often people say what is the major problem of physics that we don't know about and they say quantize graph quantum gravity now I say that's the wrong way around sure that may be a big problem and maybe someday some people have some answer to it but what good will it do you might tell you what happens inside a black hole that doesn't do you much good anyway because black holes you see the outside often you don't see what's going on inside if it's quantum gravity is playing its role right in the middle and maybe it does don't help me very much however the other way around is a huge problem well a huge issue to be resolved and what I say is the gravitation of quantum mechanics and the collapse of the wave function is what I'm really talking about because you say I'm saying the collapse of the wave function is a gravitational effect it depends on bringing ideas from general I see to be more specific the criterion that I come to here comes from the principle of equivalence principle of equivalence which says that gravitational field is equivalent to an acceleration look it goes back to Galileo Galileo is very clear on that point drop a big rock and a little rock from the leaning tower of pizza I mean I'm not sure you ever did that or the theoretical discussion if you got rid of the atmosphere sure if you drop a feather it holds us away but then that's air resistance he was in you all about that so it's was sure if you could get rid of the air big rock and the feather as people have done now on the moon or something it was showing that Galileo is right by dropping a feather and a rock on the moon quite a nice demonstration and as you can't expect anything else but what it means is that locally you would get rid of the gravitational field now you combine that with quantum mechanics and it's not quite so simple and you find that you have to monkey about with the wave function in a way which looks as though it's just a little technicality but when you think about it in a more broad context you see it's not just a technicality it tells you there's something funny going on when you try to combine the basic principle behind general relativity with quantum mechanics and it tells you in my view that you have to have collapse of the wave function and that collapse timescale is the same as dioshi tells you the mass displacement you do that calculation which I did it's tried to move a couple wave from itself how much energy is that in terms of gravity alone and that energy gives you a lifetime and that lifetime is physically there so this cup it would be instantaneous it behaves classically.

Have you played around with modern LLMs like chat GPT or Claude the only thing I ever did was there was there was some primitive version of this some mechanical woman what was her name I can't remember she was a robot oh and I did talk to her and I thought she was incredibly stupid okay I mean you you you you have to keep to the subject I think I said behind that I think behind that behind you there was a cat or something which is not looking very happy or something I don't know I remember sure she hadn't foggiest idea when I was talking about couldn't there were only just a certain number of sentences it could respond to and I felt very I thought it was very stupid because it's it's said at one point that this mechanical woman somebody had come and talked to her and the and the mechanical woman said we were going to try something different now we were trying meditating so they said they're not saying anything at all neither the person nor the robot was saying anything at all this is a big cheat oh dear I'm sure it's a lot better than that now much more convincing.

Well the reason I ask is that with the modern LLMs like Gemini or Claude or Chachy PT you can ask it to explain Gertel's incompleteness theorem to you the first one or the second one but let's just say the first one and then it will and then you could ask it to prove it and it will and you could even show it your own version of the proof with some small subtle error and it will say that's an incorrect proof why because of this and that and it will get it correct.

So does that at all chip away at? No I don't think so I don't find that all that impressive I suppose whether you can talk I mean people call it the Turing test and they say it's past the Turing test but then that really depends on who's doing the Turing testing you have to have somebody who really knows what they're talking about just an ordinary person talking without just talking ordinary about what happened to them when they came to work in the morning or something I don't know I don't know I've not been involved with these things recently I find it scary in the sense that really because people believe it's conscious and probably it will do things but then there are examples that I suppose this is a well-known example that Helen was telling me this example what was it and I have to think of the right word it's a word with raspberry I think it was oh right right yes how many hours are there yes strawberry strawberry strawberry was it strawberry how many hours in strawberry and it said two and then the person said well let's count them out and you say oh man there's a S-T-R there's one there's a double R there how many hours in strawberry two I didn't we say just three of them it's two that's not intelligence that's I mean it's it's taking a sort of average of goodness knows what I mean data conversations and somehow averaging it out I don't know I find it worrying because it's clearly not intelligent but it could be sort of persuasive enough to people that they think it is I guess there are even people who have girlfriends and boyfriends which are simply AI systems which is a bit worrying I'm afraid I don't know I've never had a not like this crazy well electronic woman which I've talked to before which is incredibly stupid I'm sure they're a lot better than that and they can probably fool you for a while I mean the most conversations you'd speak to somebody and they're fairly automatic they don't really involve the person you're speaking to being aware at all but some great could probably fool people quite not too hard I don't think probably you could fool somebody as an expert untesting these things what is intelligence to you I don't know that all I know is that whatever it is it it does involve awareness so I would say that whatever intelligence is it's a mental state somehow well it doesn't yeah there's something going on sure which just to do with consciousness and don't ask me what it is because I don't know what I'm saying is that I don't think it's it's a consequence of the laws of physics that we currently know but then there the main laws that we don't know have to do with how the gravitation of course so I talked let's say it's the other way around people say quantum gravity is the big mystery well maybe it's a good mystery but that's not the main mystery the main mystery is the gravitation of quantum mechanics the quantum mechanics this has a huge hole in it it's the collapse of the wave function and not to people who are also different views about that or they don't think about it they say well you shouldn't stop thinking about that but it doesn't make make the answer there there's an answer the wave function spontaneously collapses and it doesn't seem to be or whether a conscious being is there or not that's something else so my argument is that it's not the conscious being which collapses the wave function it's the collapse of the wave function which creates the consciousness but however that how it does it is a very very such a far off we're not closely I don't think we're close would that mean the black holes are conscious no don't see why this because they're big no don't see why they're content there's no collapse of the wave function involved in the black hole far as I know I mean maybe to make to make one you're supposed to do a bit of that on the web but the black hole is a very classical object it depends on gender relativity I see no reason to regard that as being conscious no I could be wrong do you see the black hole information paradox as a problem no I don't see it's a paradox either no it's stupid oh dear you see people say they don't like information to be destroyed that's why and black holes seem to swallow information and so they like to think it comes back again with hawking of apparition I have no reason to see why it should come back again I don't see why it shouldn't be destroyed but as I can see it probably is destroyed in singularity that I don't it's it's putting something we believe about classical physics onto I don't know I don't see why it needs to be I don't regard as a paradox you see there's two strands to this you see people say oh well it's a paradox and you resolve the paradox by hawking of apparition and this means that the information comes back again when the black hole evaporates I don't think so it's completely different information it just comes out it's not even information the word information unfortunately I think carries too many it carries a certain implication that there's something it means something I guess right I mean doesn't mean it I mean the evaporation of a black hole doesn't mean anything it's just temperatures as far as I can make out is this something that you disagreed with hawking about problem yes but I did disagree with him a few things yes I can't remember I remember the last conversation I had with him he didn't even talk it was no he was he was going to use very well I mean he he gave a talk actually at it's but he gave the first of these so-called penrose lectures that we have here in Oxford it was a good talk actually I thought he was not bad at all and he did refer to the um enter the gravitational horizon size in the black hole horizon increase which he hadn't given me any credit for previously but he did in this talk now that was that was a rather disturbing I can see what heart came about you see I had a conversation with Stephen where I described him the black hole area increase classical phenomenon and I was I said the night in Cambridge this was talk I had in the summer lecture room I described this idea to him and then in the morning he phoned me up while I was still in bed I think and he phoned me up and he said this idea he had a new way of looking at it if you could say a pair of black holes is the collide then you can get an inequality on how much how big they are and so on from the from the area and the area combined area for two holes and the final area gives you a limit on some equality and I said oh that's a wonderful idea I hadn't thought of that where how do you know where the horizon is when separated he said oh well they've got to be close very close to them and I said oh yes I see and then he wrote about this you see without any giving me any credit which did hurt me a little bit it really should have been a joint paper which he did admit afterwards that my idea came from me but I hadn't thought of using it in that way so it was certainly that was him yes but the earlier part of seeing the area of business was something I told him which he sort of grabbed himself and then only but in the talk he gave in Oxford he was more generous and he did explain the idea that he came from me he was curious sorry no it's really different it was awkward with him in many ways as was he did have terrible problem I want to do and I sometimes travel with him into a conference in Europe and I'd come back with him on the plane and I remember one occasion when somebody who was driving us to the airport took a wrong turning oh dear that was terrible and he finally got us to the airport almost much too late and I remember racing pushing him down one ramp and another one finally gets into the plane and the door was about to close finally I think they were waiting the news that we were coming they waited enough time for us to get there but that was an error squeak he said it was awkward with him at the end yes I would say so well it was difficult to talk to him well for good reason no it's only hard to talk to him and he would tend to lay down the law of it about what was I did try and talk to him about my cosmology at one point and I'm not sure he understood it probably because he'd asked me some question about it which I may have been my fault I didn't explain it very well I don't know but he had a different idea you see the House of Hawking view which I didn't believe at all and still don't believe why it gives the wrong I have to think what it is at first of all it's something about the closing off the big bang with making it you go into you you have to do a signature change so you're making it positive definite and I never like signatures changes anywhere it seemed to me they were the whole idea was wrong but the idea was if you're doing quantum gravity you can do that kind of stuff but I didn't think that's I couldn't trust anything that anybody's using quantum gravity I don't think it's explained why the big bang was so special I don't think it's given a proper explanation did you ever disagree with Wheeler on the nature of information I don't remember talking to him about it but I probably did disagree with him I don't remember he did talk about information being the most important thing or something yeah I never took it seriously see I'm not quite sure what information is when people talk about it it didn't make sense to me yeah it was oh my relation with Wheeler was a bit peculiar in many ways okay let's hear it well it was Dennis's idea you see I Dennis said you must go to America he thought that I needed to I needed to understand what was going on in quantum gravity I guess and things like that and there was I got a NATO fellowship for two years which was to go to Princeton and that was it in the advice of Dennis Sharma so I put in for it and then I got it and so I went to Princeton it was meant to be for two years I stayed about a year and a half at Princeton then I went to Syracuse because a lot of good people were going to Syracuse and that was useful more useful in a way than Princeton I think Princeton was a Princeton was a bit sort of narrow in its viewport I guess well it was very Wheeler driven Wheeler had some very definite ideas about how to do quantum gravity and things like that and I didn't think they were going to get you anywhere I think I didn't think doing quantum gravity is going to get you anywhere it's really I don't think I held this view at that time but it's the other way around you know how the gravity affects quantum mechanics but that was not I wasn't plugging out of the talent I came much later I think yeah I don't remember much about that you mentioned Vignor yeah you mentioned that he wasn't as staunch about his own interpretation that people at least ascribed to him yes that's true yes so what was more reasonable what did he believe then I think he just said it didn't it didn't know but he did think that was one possibility was the collapse of the wave function came about I mean he was worrying about the problem which I must say not a lot of people didn't but he had a genuine view I mean one possibility was even if it was the conscious being looking at the system reducing its state and I remember having a having a lunch with him which I had discuss these things with him quite a bit but I found him not so dogmatic about that particular perspective as well might have thought it I think he just thought it was a possibility but you quite liked I think you mentioned you have an Edinburgh story about Ed Witten oh yes yes there was a conference in Edinburgh and Edinburgh as you may know is divided into two there's a sort of it looks as though they used to be a river but it's dried up now I don't know if there's a trickle in the middle or not but the one side was where the hotel was where we were saying and the other side was where the conference was that's where you had to go wrong long this narrow bridge to go to the other side and I was not very early and my bit late getting up in the morning to go to this talk and whenever I would get up I would see Ed Witten waiting for me he wanted to talk to me so okay so we did walk and he asked me this question which he was worrying him out he was worrying that the cosmological constant should be negative because his picture of string blah blah blah blah blah all that stuff required it's fine they know they still do I'm not sure a negative cosmological constant and I said no the evidence is strong this is positive you're not going to get away with it being negative and he was very upset because he wanted me to give him the freedom to have a negative cosmological function he wanted you to give him the freedom I think he wanted me to be more open minded about it I was just taking the evidence for it but I don't it's not much of a story that it's just that he was waiting waiting didn't mind being a little late for the lecture if he could try and persuade me to have a negative cosmological constant which I wasn't prepared to do just thought the evidence was really strong I mean there's second there's an earlier part to that story which is not Witten the earlier part of the story was to deal with an American cosmologist an interesting fellow after God oh I shouldn't know who you're sorry but he was visiting England and I think we were going into dinner maybe my college and as we were going in it was in the early days when the red shift which suggested that there was a positive cosmological constant come along and I didn't like it you see at that time I thought it should be zero from some idea to do with swiss theory and I wanted to try and I had a solution to what I called the googly problem and the solution depended on it being null infinity being null so I have zero cosmological constant and that was my idea and I remember going into dinner and I said surely this red shift for these dust could be dust as some people were saying and he said no no that doesn't work it's not just that it fits so well but all sorts of things and they've come together so well if you have a positive cosmological constant so I changed my mind it's okay we had to get used to the idea I'm glad I did because the whole idea of ccc depends on the cosmological constant being positive absolutely you've got to have a space like infinity I knew it meant it space like infinity I mean I work out down previously I knew it meant that but I didn't want it previously attentive to visit him sometimes in Princeton so I went to visit him one point and I had some ideas about twisted theory I wanted to talk to him about or something I don't remember him being Ed Witten?

Ed Witten yes yes no I wanted to talk I mean it was useful to talk to him he was had interesting ideas and so I started to he he talked to me he said he started to describe something blah blah blah blah blah blah and I think that looks like twisted theory and he said yes it is he was using twisted theories to try and do calculations in quantum gravity or something and so at the end of that I said that sounds very interesting now he said to me I'm thinking of writing a very short paper and a short note paper on this would be a paper to look at it so I said yes sure I waited two months and then there's a hundred page paper okay and that hundred page paper it was 99 pages I think but you know and I gave it to some of my colleagues and students and then they went discussing this paper which was bringing twisted theory in connection with gravitational calculations and it sort of started off a whole line of thinking in my group and we then we had Ed Witten we invited him over and I think he had a combined discussion with all these ideas I'm not sure it was a good idea actually the whole thing because people had got carried off in a particular direction I mean it was probably close to when I retired anyway so it didn't matter too much to what went on although I kept up my contact with these people I think I had a view that it probably was carrying people not quite in it was an interesting interesting to see how the how the string ideas that he was having did relate to just the ideas but on the other hand at least wrong I think I thought it wasn't a good idea why not and also do you mind explaining the idea the semblance that you recall I'm not sure I can remember it though it was trying to bring I think string theory ideas into connection with twisted theory ideas and it was a kind of set people thinking off on the along new directions which was interesting sure but the thing is I'm not so convinced about string theory myself I think I can't remember the details of it because I think I was not really in full you see it's the time when I retired I think and so I was not really didn't have a group of people who are doing research with me and they went off on their own and developed certain ideas I probably shouldn't comment too much because I don't think I understand it well enough what about Richard Feynman I know you've told several Feynman stories oh I've got several of them yeah now there are about six Feynman stories so much right is there one that you haven't told much or at all even I have to think there probably is one yes I don't know because I usually tell them all over Tommy Gold's one see I'm a first met Feynman as a conference which was being held in Poland a bit north of Warsaw and it was just as a time when that the sort of Cold War was starting to thought a little bit and they had people from both sides of the Iron Curtains when then Mars until there were some Russians there too and Poland already was on the other side of the Iron Curtain so I remember I had the thing is that my then wife was very keen on getting a Volkswagen which we bought for and we picked it up in Wolfsburg where they made the cars yes and we picked it up fresh from the place where they made them I think we must have left our old one with them I can't remember the story exactly I think that was right it was a new car and I remember driving through checkpoint Charlie and all that sort of thing it was all behind the Iron Curtain you see at that time but it was there was a bit of a saw and at this conference Feynman was there and I actually talked him a little bit about some ideas I had about doing zigzag sort of integrals using zigzags for the working out the electron field or something and he seemed to be quite interested in what I was saying but I don't know how much of an impression that made but what I do know is that at the end of the conference there were a group of people were going to a hotel in northern Poland where the mountainous area apparently and it was a question of enjoying the mountain scenery and going to this hotel but this involved a bus trip to the hotel and you had to get a complete ticket with the bus and the hotel and then the bus coming back and since I had a car I didn't want the bus so I wanted to go to the hotel and so we tried to find out where the hotel was and the people refused they wouldn't tell us no we don't tell you and I complained to Feynman about this they're not going to tell us about so he said I'll find light for you so anyway so the day came we were just about to drive off somewhere I didn't quite know where at this point Feynman came up to us and handed a little piece of paper a little piece of name of a hotel I don't know how he'd found out because they were absolutely adamant not to tell us and the reason they weren't telling it wasn't anything to do with the iron curtain and all that well it wasn't the sense but the reason was they were charging everybody twice as much as the official price and so we got the ordinary price when we went out there but people who paid for the tour they've been paid twice as much and that was the reason and then we drove back and I think we did to come back through the iron curtain or whatever it was called but that was the first encounter with Feynman which wasn't much of a story really the man I think the man for there's some one there was a beautiful set of photographs people took of this conference people and one of the most magnificent of these is Feynman picture Feynman and Dirac and there's Feynman towards with his hands like this somehow trying to explain something and this Dirac sort of leaning back rather kind of reserved yes and it's a wonderful picture yes the captures their personalities absolutely yes that's right yeah hi everyone hope you're enjoying today's episode if you're hungry for deeper dives into physics AI consciousness philosophy along with my personal

I very much regretted never met Schrodinger because I used to go quite frequently to the place where Schrodinger went in Ireland you see he had an appointment in Ireland at the institute for advanced studies and I quite frequently went there but it only unfortunately after Schrodinger left the closest I got to Schrodinger was his daughter one of his daughters I think had I had a conversation with her and I met her and I had a cop two copies of Schrodinger's but what is life or something and so she had two copies and so she extrained copies my copy with his signature on it or something I can't remember I never actually met Schrodinger but one with my signature and hers I had Schrodinger's daughter signature so I met his daughter but you know that was a regret of mine because I thought I sort of could have met Schrodinger I would like to have met him very much because I had a I thought he was a fascinating character and he wrote I mean I was a great fan of his writings because Schrodinger was somebody who wrote popular books was semi-populated might say yes and very good ones and I think I had all his books did that inspire you to write your own book I think it did probably yes I think it was an influence yes so I think if Schrodinger do it well maybe I can I don't know yeah tell me about the writing of Emper's new mind did you already have those ideas worked out prior to you starting the book well I had I knew why I wanted to write it but what I didn't know was how the brain could be making use of what I think it needed you see and so I learned a bit about neurophysiology and there is a whole section in the book about neurophysiology and I thought it was a fascinating subject but I learned about the Hodgkin Huxley nerve transmission and I said there's no hope you can't preserve coherence that way doesn't answer my problems so when I got to the end of my book I hoped that I would have an answer to see where in the brain there could be something which could employ the collapse of the way function and I didn't it was left to blank to me I couldn't see anywhere so I ended up with something very weak that I didn't believe in really something about crystals which is in the book which my excuse for but you know but it was not no no it's kind of peaked out at the end although there was a description of the experiment due to Benjamin Libbert which I thought fascinating I suppose I think they're not legal to do now because they should be repeated there were experiments which had to do with the timing of conscious experience the readiness potential and free will telling someone to decide when to make a movement I think there are two different things you see this was yes that may have been part of it it wasn't so much that it was the sensory aspect is he there was a patient who had an operation on the brain for some other reason and permission was given for the for limits I guess to perform experiments on this person which probably would not be legal he's not says people tell me which is a shame because they're fascinating experiments I do describe them in roughly in in my book the opposite moment at the end and the thing is that there's an electrode which touches the finger and the sensation of that and then there's another electrode in that part of the brain which has to do with the sensation of the finger being touched sensory part of the brain and it's all to do with the timing and there's a clock which is a fast moving clock and the patient has to try and say when he or she feels this and if you touch the finger then it's almost instantaneous apparently if you touch the part of the brain to do with the sensory that it takes a little while in the sense of half a second not quite a long time before that part gets maybe it was a quarter of a second I can't you know how sure I think it's half a second not quite a long time in a sense and then there are things about if you touch the finger first and then the brain then the brain sensation yes the finger one seems to be instantaneous the one on the brain takes half a second before it's felt before the patient registers feeling it is curious already curious but if you touch the finger and then a quarter of a second later do the brain stimulation then the brain stimulation is felt but the finger stimulation is unfelt how can you unfeel something which you should already have felt so there's something strange about the temporal exactly when things are felt and so on but just and this ties in with other things too yes which it seems for example if you're if you're playing a sport or something which I used to play ping pong a lot not too huge skill but I played it and the I would see the I think you know the current view is that the conscious it takes a while for conscious that maybe half a second now I think that's ridiculous because if I wanted to decide whether to hit the ball that way that way I see where I think the opponent is and maybe do it that way you see that's much less than half a second then they say oh no it's all unconscious no I was I can no I was deciding to do this right no it can't be it must be it's an illusion you're not really conscious doing it so that's I don't know if it's the current view no or not but it had been the current view it's none of all these things you think you're doing consciously are really unconscious I thought that's ridiculous I mean and I hear if you're piano playing you say they might touch a note I mean peace may be very you know lots and lots and lots of notes going within a half a second and uh they decide whether to hit this note maybe slightly more delicately than before that's a conscious decision no no it doesn't you I can't have time to do that must be unconscious which you see it's probably the the timing of these things is is not a straightforward issue I'm when you think something I don't know but you see if if it's to do I can't make any definite statement how well I think is that there's some monkey business going on okay when I say monkey business it's some subtlety which you can't explain using classical physics somehow I knew you were going to say monkey business I think it's either that or poppycock I didn't think that one applied in this case yes it's it's when monkey business tends to me there's something going on there it's not just random I just spoke to a neuroscientist named Aaron sugar who's reinterpreted the limit experiments and he said that we've been making a mistake seeing that there's this potential that comes on approximately half a second to one second prior to us deciding to make some action you can't go from that to infer that okay the decision must have been unconscious therefore we didn't actually decide it because he was saying well there's a correlation but the correlation doesn't imply causation and then in his model he gives an analogy he says if I put on some measuring devices on you that measure your health across the season they will show small dip prior to you getting the flu does that mean that that small dip caused you to get the flu well some other people get a lower dip as well but then don't get the flu so there's this line of reasoning that he goes through and says that he can get this reaction time for consciousness down to actual reaction time which is 50 milliseconds or so which is much more an alignment to you consciously deciding to swing the ping pong ball rather than what people told you before which is no you think you decided it but you just unconsciously decided it and then some post-hawk rationalization told you I decided it is you slightly complicated when I begin interested to see what it is yeah see my view is it's probably not explicable by classical physics that there is something you see there is something retro called nothing to do with this at all so I usually don't bring this sort of thing into my arguments at all it's not necessary too speculative it's bringing in consciousness which I prefer not to this is here you should I think that's a whole story which I've dabbled in it's true but it's not something which I could probably seriously contribute to because it requires understanding too much biology and things like that which Zach I sometimes say you know the isn't sorry I shouldn't be confusing all my stories but originally I was supposed to be a doctor my both my parents were medical and they had decided that I was the one who was going that was before my sister grew up and actually did become a doctor and married one so they got two for the price of one but they were very disappointed when I went and did mathematics instead but that's all the sort of irrelevant to the story except that it's just as well I didn't do that because I would I would never have understood I would never remember the different medications that people were supposed to have I forgot them confused because I wouldn't remember the different names that's all I'm trying to say because when it comes to things like biology it's really not my area because it involves different kinds of chemical compounds and one of them they're doing in which kinds is which and what name is attached to which one and no I can't do that kind of thing so I don't want to what I'm trying to say is the consciousness issue if you're really going to get into what it involves and say human consciousness it's there's a lot of biology involved on that and there has to be because that's what we're all biological systems so it's not going to do it it's not I'm not my area I was speaking to Dr.

Michael Levin who's a biologist to developmental biologist oh yeah he wanted to know well what he's doing is extending platonic space to include biological systems and minds as well he had a question for you he wanted to know if you thought platonic space has its own dynamics or if it's just eternal and static so that was one question and then he said do that one it's eternal and static I mean it's there's no temporal time doesn't come into it it's just mathematics and mathematical truth it's temporal thing it's true I mean it doesn't involve time nothing to do with it I mean you can talk about physics and of course that involves time his second question was do you think this platonic space includes more than just mathematics but I'm using what you mean by platonic space I suppose I'm not sure I understand the question you see the platonism I refer to in the sense of mathematics having its existence independent of us independent of mathematicians it's it's to do mathematics is a bit more like archaeology than you might think there's the platonic world out there you know digging away at his new find some beautiful result which is sitting there waiting to be discovered or it doesn't care where he discovers or not that's not it's concern so the mathematical world is there it's not created by us trying to do mathematics that's that's the only sense but when you say giving something else a platonic existence that sort of and you don't know quite what that means where you're trying what what what was the thing okay let me read the question for the audience as well all right you've said you're a platonist about mathematics does the mathematical realm exist independently of physical reality is the mantle brought set out there even if the universe didn't exist and do the contents of platonic space have dynamics of their own you've answered that already what's the best way to think about the interaction between platonic objects which presumably don't have time and physical objects or processes which operate in time but I've usually you know I have the strut sort of triangular picture which I like to draw as an impossible object and these are will I call for three worlds and the three mysteries I mean I used to talk about this I haven't done it much recently and the worlds are the platonic mathematical world and the physical world and the mental world yes and then they she the but then the connections of the three mysteries so I'm calling them mysteries you see one of the mysteries is the physical world and how that depends on mathematics which seems to be a very close connection but not every pitting in the mathematical you said the way I draw it is only a little bit of the mathematical world seems to be governing see there is a sort of view that people have oh this is such a beautiful piece of mathematics it must have a relevance to the physical world not at all the no reason why it should there's a lot of very beautiful mathematics going on which as far as we can see has no connection with physics at all of course it might have some distant physical theory that comes about but I don't see any reason why it should have this comes out particularly with things when they talk about hard dimensional theories you see like it's string theory and all that they like they like to use these different dimensions of space and so on I don't see any reason for that at all just because you've got a mathematical theory which can can exist in higher dimensions no reason why physics should follow it and then you see again there's a next mystery which is that only part of the physical world seems to have consciousness so that's a mystery too and and then I say well most of conscious activity is not thinking about mathematics even you're of the mathematician you like to have your lunch too and you like to have your cappuccino exactly so it's not it's not just mathematics then I don't know how much most mathematicians think about mathematics but certainly it's not all the time with me a little bit only a small amount of time especially when I get older I can't you know it's hard for me to think about it I know you called yourself a physicalist which is a monist which means there's only one kind of substance and it's just a physical substance the way that I read your work is at least a dualist it could be a tri-list because of this so there's the physical realm the mental realm and then the platonic realm and it's not clear to me that the platonic realm is dependent on the physical or vice versa it seems like they're distinct so at least there would be a dualism it seems like we can make this triality this triangle into a rectangle because the physical itself splits into quantum and classical okay I'm not sure you see how distinct they are or what it's a useful yeah okay when you said quantum mechanics you see I'm not saying that's the separate world because it's all the same world but these are notions of reality which I find useful to think I'm not sure whether I tie that in with the philosophy so much I think it's both physics they're both physics you see the quantum reality in the classical reality whether they are even separate or whether they're the only maybe you have some continuum spread between the two and so on it's just useful way of of thinking about quantum theories relationship the classical mechanics or the measurement problem about it's it's I'm saying it's probably a temporary position to hold probably Sam I worry about that a bit I mean just say quantum reality in classical maybe there's a whole different maybe continuum of possible I'm not wanting to I'm not being trying to be dogmatic about that I just think it's a useful way to think about certain things see particularly one thing I wish I'd put in you see the article which I discuss these ideas most completely is in a book edited by Shan Gao on consciousness and quantum mechanics or something it's just a collection of articles and I have an article in that book I think it talks for the university press and I have an article in that book where I describe this quantum reality in classical reality but one thing I rather regretted is not putting in something which I could have done because I have a nice picture of it which is with EPR Einstein-Podosky Rosen situation you know what I mean by that so you see Alison Bob I present it there's a spin zero particle it splits into two spin halves Alison Bob each have a sealed box where they're not allowed to see this and they go a long way off from light years away maybe certain point Alice opens her box and okay it's a spin half particle so she has to choose a direction and say okay are you spinning this way yes or no and it says nope you got me wrong it's the other way so it fixes her spin as the opposite now Bob's must therefore be the opposite of Alice's but when well you should people worry about this and John Bell used to argue about these things all that but my view to make it relatively invariant you have to go along the past light cone so you go along the past light cone backwards in time to earlier time if you like and that his particles now flipped to be the opposite of what Alice measures now that sort of retro causal now just not gonna land you in all sorts of paradoxes no because it's quantum reality if Bob could say hello particle which way are you spinning yeah you'd be in trouble but all Bob can do is decide on a direction and then say hello particle do you happen to be spinning this way or the other way it says you got me right this time doesn't tell him that's a spin you can't the very fact that its quantum reality means he can't ascertain what the spin state is you can only confirm it if he has reason to believe that it might be so and so you can test that whether that's right or not this is the Einstein criterion but the Einstein criterion is only quantum reality it doesn't tell you you can't ask the system hello system what's your state it looks blankly at you and say I don't ask the questions like that suggested direction and you need that point of view to make sense of it and I like to put the the whole picture you see of Alice and Bob in the different regions where the state is so and so and its whole consistent level the whole picture I find that quite surprising that the actual quantum reality of all over the whole picture is completely consistent I've slightly regretting not having put this picture into my article but maybe that'll be a new article I think you see I'm supposed to write up my basil highly look lecture and I was just reminded somebody said you're going to produce your article which on this and I said well I suppose to do that and he said well I believe you give you a little bit more time thanks so I have to write this article and maybe I can put this in you see I think I mentioned it in the actual lecture showing Alice and Bob and all that stuff and you can have a nice picture showing whether what the quantum reality is all over the whole picture and it's completely consistent but it has a quite funny kind of causality relationship which not it's not the ordinary way of propagating within the light cone it's sort of without without the past light cone which is very strange now I'd like to end on how you view the state of current theoretical physics fundamental physics when I ask this to people they tend to split into two camps one that says there are some problems and then they split into some camps as to what the cause of that problem is maybe they'll say well the cause is that experiments are just too expensive to run to probe even deeper than we need the problem is that quantum mechanics is too successful and it would be great if there was something that was disagreeing with the standard model.

Funny how people see how successful well you see there are all kinds of experiments where you don't perturb them it's way below the the delhi level you see these experiments and it works extraordinarily well sure does but you don't move much mass there's a huge story there if you're asking me am I one of these people we're nearly there just to find your details and not one of those people and one of the people that said no there's a big theory behind and behind that we just don't know at all if that's what you want to know I want to know if you've noticed a difference over the past few decades as to how fundamental physics is researched so for instance as I was mentioning there are two camps one that thinks it's gone awry for some reason and one that thinks no it's broadly on track and it's operating as usual we're just dealing with extremely difficult problems what do you see?

I mean it's probably the same as the quantum mission issue I because it works so well when you don't move much mass around people get sort of convinced that it's the full answer and I don't think that's right at all no there's a huge thing missing is that why in our first conversation you mentioned quantum mechanics is wrong or quantum theory is wrong and then of course the objection as well it's extremely accurate you could say it's incomplete that's not the same as it being wrong so is that what you mean that look sure quantum mechanics is extremely correct I like to be rude or about it you see she's stroding on Einstein we're much more polite they said well quantum mechanics is incomplete okay to say that I like to be more brutal and says actually wrong but I mean that's fine we're not really just agreeing it's just terminology I'm saying that it's a big thing that's missing incomplete rather suggest oh there's a little detail oh change the sun here oh that's it I don't mean that I mean that the broad framework needs overhauling and in the limit of not much mass displacement it's quantum mechanics sure if you have mass displacements it goes wrong very rapidly you know some people say well about what the Planck scale you see well what is the Planck mass the Planck mass is a flea's eye more or less yes if what a flea's eye in two places at once maybe with a flea's looking that way that way at the same time does it collapse the wave function yes because a flea's eye is a Planck mass and it's collapses in the Planck time what is the Planck time 10 to the man is 30 seconds or something ridiculous this small time so it would be flea's eyes classical because the collapse time is so tiny in experiments sure I'm on an expert on experiments but the experiments which have been which convinced show you quantum mechanics is right there's no practically no mass displacement involves in these experiments so of course you get the right out I mean I'm going to course it's amazing I'm not saying it's course really I'm probably mechanics isn't an amazing revolution there's no question about that I do agree with that but if you considering displacing masses it gives you the wrong answer tiny fraction of a second is saying that because certain things work so well tells you the theory is right no it doesn't because all these experiments are in the regime where you hardly move a mass around tall is there any piece of advice that you consistently give your students no because I don't have any students or you only taught mathematics you see I don't you say I was always in mathematics mathematics departments I taught mathematics I occasionally taught I did teach quantum mechanics that's true and I would waste a lot of time I realized what a fool I was the whole first two lectures I wasted because I was all all on this stuff the philosophy of it and why collect wave function collapses or something and I shouldn't waste the amount of time on that because I had a race and a great speed to try and catch up with a syllabus if you want to teach the course you have to you have to teach what's in the course not trying to explain one of the things but then the people obviously worry about it and there is this feeling somehow that big systems because you it's too much trouble to make the quantum state of the big system or else you're like the philosophers used to be in Oxford I don't think they like that now where you go into the many worlds picture and say all these different alternatives coexist somehow and the reality of the situation is a huge mass of all the different things that should might happen and somehow a conscious being threads its way through this huge entangled mass of things so that's one resolution that you call it a resolution which used to be a keen on the philosophers and I'm not sure whether it's true anymore because the person has a funny story there David Wallace I think that's his name yes but he's he's he's gone to Princeton I remember going to a very small conference about six people and we used to discussing these issues and David Wallace is one of the people and then the thing all finished and I thought well I'm glad this is all over and then I could go home and David Wallace said he's all right if I walk with you he said yeah that's all right so chat with him for a while and I think I hope we'll get to a corner where he goes to his office because different way and I can relax a bit no no he turns the same way he's waiting out this way no he turns the same way this way oh well we're going to the same flat complex comes in the same doors me go up same floor he's just down the corridor he doesn't live there anymore now because he's gone to Pittsburgh it was funny chances again snack must be quite large have you ever spoken to Douglas Hofstetter about your theory of consciousness and girdles there okay I'll tell you about the Hofstetter story I was going to have lunch with him so I did but before lunch there was an occasion where we could discuss things with him and I read his book a newest point of view and I thought he'd come to the wrong conclusion and I had decided I was going to point paint him into a corner you see so I started painting him into this corner and the corner I was going to paint him into is that certain integers are conscious right and I only got you know I'll go into the corner he's simply leapt into the corner watch me to the side and then this is a conscious yeah that was my Hofstetter story I think we had quite a nice lunch afterwards but I just find it so extraordinary I need quite consistent that was the view that he was driving for but it seemed to me an absurdity but he didn't think it was an absurdity he just thought so oh yeah something to just happen to be conscious that's all okay I think that is you like like professor I've had such a great time speaking with you okay thank you for spending two hours with me oh goodness I hope I'm not wasting the time was event should have been here yes if it just came through the door and just for the people who are wondering what this is about event when test is now coming and we're going to do another podcast jointly on event itself is that right no she's going to be with you but we're going to take a break so there's three podcasts there's this one with Roger solo there's one with the vet and Roger and then there's one with the vet solo that's what I was expecting yes oh she's doing an experiment which is testing this idea about the state reduction which is a very important experiment we're going to talk all about quantum gravity and collapse models with the vet in a few minutes okay thank you no it's always been great fun thank you yes I hope you enjoy that interview with sir Roger Penrose there's another interview with said sir Roger Penrose coming up in a couple weeks in that interview we discussed a sensitive experiment it's in the pre-publishing phases currently that experiment or at least the results of it and so once it's officially published then I have to go ahead to launch it so subscribe for that now it takes a huge amount of time to prepare for interviews like this I study the guests papers I study adjacent fields I construct quizzes for myself and then perform those or test myself for weeks prior I then also talk to the guests colleagues often so that I ensure that I have their the guest point of view correct in my head and then I'm not wasting the guest time or your time it also takes a considerable amount of money to travel from a place like say Toronto to Oxford to film with Roger or to film at Boston at MIT or Harvard people think that YouTube ad revenue is high however in science and philosophy they're one of the lowest paying categories so I directly rely on the support from generous donors such as potentially yourself if you have the funds and you're willing then there are three primary ways to contribute one is to become a founding member on sub stack of course becoming any paying member on sub stack is great but the founding members the top tier number two is giving a one-time donation via PayPal and number three is to give a one-time donation via crypto links to all of these are in the description many people think that theories of everything this channel is a huge team it's a huge production actually it's just two or three people it's myself and my wife and of course the full-time editor who is editing this thank you and that's all to say that your donations go a long way thank you for getting us over 500,000 YouTube subscribers that's magnificent and it's all thanks to you thank you
