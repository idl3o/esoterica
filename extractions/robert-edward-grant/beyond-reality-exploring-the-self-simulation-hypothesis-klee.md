## Transcript

Clea is a very successful entrepreneur who has been able to transition his life into this higher pursuit of trying to understand the nature of what is. He also leads the Quantum Gravity Institute. The past no longer exists and the future obviously doesn't exist and that was the old school view and then we realized as backed by some experiments that it's bizarre but the future actually exists and so too does the past continue to exist.

One might say, well who cares? Why are Robert and Clea talking about primes? Well primes everyone are the essence, right? The skeleton, the core of these important numbers for physics and life which are the counting numbers, right? That how many of a thing do I have and the core of them is the primes. What we're talking about here is what Clea is saying as well is that the future also determines the past.

Clea Irwin, what a pleasure to have you with me here on the Think Tank. I've been so excited to have this conversation with you. It's been since the beginning of the year that I've been excited for this conversation and maybe even before that we had a chance to meet at a New Year's Eve party and everyone was interested to hear what we had to say for the first 20 or 30 minutes and then I think we kind of cleared them out because we got deep in some real discussion about math and physics and simulation theory and emergence theory and all these really exciting things and for those that you don't know, Clea is a very successful entrepreneur who has been able to transition his life into this higher pursuit of trying to understand the nature of what is.

That's kind of the best way I can describe it and maybe also to seek to understand some of the questions why and maybe seek some answers associated with that and it's very, very excited to have him here. He also leads the Quantum Gravity Institute which is in Southern California and I'm super excited to have him here.

His institute has been responsible for publishing over 120 some odd peer-reviewed publications and physics and probably number theory and sort of spanning several different areas of the topics. So you've become your own little kind of university in a way. Yeah, love institute with less politics because we can say we can explore scientifically anything that we're curious about without being judged by peers who might at a university right who might otherwise blacklist or shun us for having outside the box thinking.

Well, I look at you also as someone who's like near and dear to my own heart because your path and my path have kind of been quite similar in some ways. We were both entrepreneurs who were in business and everything and said okay, what do we want to do with the world or what do we want to do with our experience for the rest of our lives and you know I went through like a major shift.

I was a farmer CEO and then decided to start my own group of companies and and part of that I got involved with NISIM Hairman also looking at quantum gravity and the quantization of gravity and trying to understand the relationship between gravity and electromagnetism and radiation and you've just been on this path.

So tell me how in the heck did you make the transition? I'm just super fascinated. How did you go from being the successful entrepreneur to that one day that you said okay, I'm going to work on quantum gravity now. Well, it was a little bit of a situation that felt kind of supernatural. You know, let's be honest, the word supernatural means whatever your theory of nature is, if something happens that doesn't fit that theory, it's supernatural.

So if we go back to the theory of reality 150 years ago, then the idea that I've got a Wi-Fi signal right now all around me that is supernatural relative to a theory of physics that was dominant 150 years ago. So anyway, if somebody today claims to have a anomalous cognition event, right, such as remote viewing that they worked on at Stanford research or a premonition, any access to what we call non-local information would today be judged as supernatural, but tomorrow it may be judged as natural.

So what happened to me 15 years ago is I was a happy, go lucky materialist, atheist, minding my own business and enjoying my life making a lot of money. And I had a company we're doing, I don't know, 500 and 100 million a year, I was making money, I owned the whole thing, I didn't have shareholders, I was having fun playing monopoly, making money.

And so anyway, so the event that happened is something that you're either going to think, oh my god, I'm going insane and delusional, or wait a minute, am I going insane or something real happening? And what it was was it was as though, did you ever see the movie Close Encounters of the first? And remember the firemen?

May the fourth be with you. But today is mostly people, firemen, schoolteachers, people of different walks of life in the beginning of the movie, they were getting obsessed with that shape, okay? And buildings, potatoes, and yeah, it's your driver's job. Now, if you look at any one of them individually and you could say, well, they're clearly going insane, that is clearly a delusional weirdo going insane, and except in the movie, they weren't going insane.

They were getting access to non-local information. They were being kind of inspired or connected to some field of meaning. And anyway, so that's kind of something like what happened to me, and it felt as though it was, for lack of better word, versions of myself or conscious entities that are part of a future evolution that had looped back to somehow make contact with myself 15 years ago.

And the concept was, well, do you still want to do this program, this project, this work, which I had been obsessed with at that time, right? A lot of stuff that we'll talk about today. Hi, I'm Robert Edward Grant. I invite you to explore my transformative books, Phylo Math and Polymath, each designed to expand your understanding of the world and ourselves.

In Phylo Math, which means lover of learning, discover how mathematics weaves together, physics, music, and prime number theory, revealing the universe's interconnected nature. It's more than a book. It's an enlightening voyage. Polymath builds on Phylo Math's insights, exploring the genius of thinkers like Pythagoras and Da Vinci, who use geometry to revolutionize science, art, and governance.

Rediscover the polymathic roots that sparked past ages of enlightenment. Join me on this journey as well. Visit RobertEdwardGrant.com to get your copies today. Let's foster a new era of enlightenment and collaboration for a brighter future. Not in a nutshell, to summarize, you know, answer to your question, Robert, is about 15 years ago, happy-go-lucky materialist atheist, I start getting what appeared to me at the time to be anomalous cognition events where it seemed like I was either going insane and delusional or I was coming into contact with information, meaning, thought, whatever you want to call it, that was not local to me.

And it presented, you know, the meaning was presenting itself as though it was patterns of myself and my friends, maybe who might not even know yet from the future of the evolution of society. And at what point in time in the future, I have no idea. And it was as though it was an invitation to continue with something I had agreed to do.

And there was a question that came through at one point, do you still want to do this, this work? And I said, yeah, I understand what you mean by this work. It's this, you know, this work on a new cosmological model and, you know, really just kind of synthesizing all these ideas that have been spontaneously dropping into my mind in the last few months, you know, again, 15 years ago, and synthesizing that into a paradigmatic, you know, new view that can hopefully bridge the paradigms of the studies of mind and consciousness, that can even include ideas that one might call spiritual, but that I just call non-local aspects of reality with mathematical physics at the most fundamental level.

And so then what happened is I had to effectively become a physicist, right? So I had been an amateur physicist, my whole life, like an amateur astronomer, but I wanted to go full-time. So I went full-time, I started spending millions of dollars having a staff of PhD mathematicians and physicists, and we began trying to derive meaning and further advancing on these thoughts that had started to self-assemble in my mind.

And now 15 years later, we have a cosmological model that called the self-simulation hypothesis interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is agnostic to the type of math and the type of approach one uses, and I'd love to share that with you. And then we work on one application or physics model, if you will, or model of reality that can live within that agnostic self-simulation hypothesis.

And that model is called the emergence theory. And I'd love you a couple sound bites about that after I break down the gist of what this self-simulation hypothesis is about. So in a lot of the way, I'd like to give the listeners here an opportunity with, to understand the simulation hypothesis that Elon Musk, you know, basically posts about and a lot of legit scientists believe is real.

I can explain that in less than, you know, 45 seconds by just asking your listeners to mentally answer for themselves two or three questions. And the answer is to let's go for it. I mean, I definitely teach a big advocate. I've been a big advocate for simulation hypothesis for a long time, not necessarily all in the same ways that it would be posited by Nick Bostrom.

Yes. But I'm definitely a fan of the whole generalized concept of it. And yes, I think, you know, Elon has probably popularized it because he was one of the first to really make kind of broad comments about it in the media, etc. And it's just naturally getting more popular as otherworldly science fiction levels of ultra-strong AI come on the scene as processing continues to get, you know, faster as my son's multiplayer video games are now starting to all of a sudden look photorealistic, right?

Yep. So, Apple Vision Pro. Yeah. Apple Vision Pro is a anyone that I put Apple Vision Pro on, they literally come away after they take it off and say, we live in a simulation, don't we? Oh, thank you. So it's going to be trending. Now, so what I'll do is I want to just get the simulation hypothesis of Bostrom and Elon Musk's, you know, as a popular fan, I want to just get that to the side really fast because way I'd like to explain the self-simulation hypothesis is by contrast as an alternative version.

So play dumb and I'll just ask you these two or three questions and you'll get served as a proxy for your audience here. All right. So Robert, yes. So are you willing to say that it's probably true that as time goes on, our computer simulations will get increasingly more realistic until eventually they are indistinguishable from reality, probably.

Yes. Okay. And second question, are you willing to say that in the future, when that probably happens, two or more of our descendants will probably run an origin or an ancestor simulation of their reality from some origin point that they can pick at a proverbial big bang or anything else along the way and or that one will do two or more.

In other words, will there be in the future probably two or more utterly realistic simulations of reality that eventually occur given enough time? Sure. All right. So because you said probably to both of those two questions by deduction, it means that you are saying it's probably true that there's at least a two-thirds chance because you said you said probably two or more that there's probably at least a two-thirds chance that we are not in the one real reality.

So that means you, like Elon Musk, are a simulation theory proponent. So now let me contrast that with the self-simulation hypothesis. Now hidden in the simulation hypothesis is a dirty little secret. And the dirty little secret is a religious or mystically inspired philosophy called materialism. So it was invented by the Greeks about 5,000 years ago.

It had a lot of very cool mysticism and religious type of underpinnings. And it is essentially a viewpoint with zero scientific evidence. And it kind of goes something like this. Yeah, we do understand that quantum mechanics unapologetically and bluntly says reality is made of information. And yet we want a hand wave that off and say that information merely conveniently describes some fundamental mystical stuff called energy, space time, and matter.

Now we do not know where those mysterious things come from. We do not know what they are made of. And we do not have any actual evidence that they exist. We have evidence that reality is made of information in the context of quantum mechanics. And so you can see it's okay to, as a physicist, it's okay to take a wild ass guess.

But you have to admit, as a good scientist, where the guest has oodles of evidence in experimental peer-review literature and where it has none. And in the case of the philosophy of materialism, there is flat out zero experimental scientific evidence. It's just a philosophy. The alternative philosophy is that reality is made of information.

And this is what quantum mechanics says in an unapologetic way. Now we must, for the conversation at least, have a working definition of what this word information is. So for us at quantum gravity research, we take a pretty conservative view that information is meaning conveyed by symbolism. For example, a bird language, this natural language, English, zeros and ones and how you can organize them into bites in packages of four bits.

And so on. Every single instance of information ever dealt with in the sciences, whether emergent information like the meanings in this conversation or fundamental, you know, bit or tube information, it's always meaning conveyed by symbolism. Now what is symbolism? Well, symbolism is essentially a part of symbolic systems or languages or codes.

We can just use those terms interchangeably. And a language or code is also very easy to define. And that is a finite set of symbols. Okay. And rules on how you can relate the symbols. And a third ingredient is within the rules, you have to have syntactical degrees of freedom such that it's not just a deterministic algorithm.

And English fits all three of those bills. So we have about 50,000 words in our language, you know, basic ones. And we have rules on how we can arrange them and we have freedom. So there's a rule that says, I will get arrested by the English police if I say the dog ran cat. It's against the law. Can't do it.

But I mean dog ran slowly, even no training data, because I'm a large language model and a transformer, but I'm biological. And my my probability, my outputs as generative biological intelligence are based in large part on my training data, everything I've experienced. So for me, it's more probable that I will say the dog ran fast if you team me up with the dog ran blank.

But it's not guaranteed because I might be in a spicy rebellious mood and just refuse to say the obvious and I'll say the dog ran slowly. All right. So reality is like this. We have a fundamental set of letters called fundamental particles, corks, electrons, neutrinos, and so on. And we have this viewpoint that like letters, like bits, that in all codes, there's an irreducible symbol, right, or letter.

And so we think in the popular canonical view, we say, okay, reality is made of, you know, this quantity of letters that you can count on your fingers and toes, the fundamental particles. And they have rules and degrees of freedom. For example, we have the Kapali exclusion principle, right? There's things that just can't be done.

You can't relate to or more particles in certain ways. There's laws, rules. And then within those, there's degrees of freedom. And so reality itself, and then you have all languages are also hierarchical so that your proverbial letters go to your words, go to your sentences, to your proverbial paragraphs.

We have the fundamental particles, self-organizing into words that you can call nuclei, you know, neutrons and protons. And then those self-organize into atoms, like clauses of a sentence. And then those self-organize into molecules, like DNA, like entire sentences. And it just keeps going up and up. And so all language has this hierarchical quality.

So part of it's funny you say that because in my track through a similar experience, what you describe with getting, for lack of a better term, downloads, right? Starting at about 20, I would say it got really intense from 2014 on, but it started probably more like around 2010. Mine started in 2010, 2009, maybe 2010, it started, it's about 15 years ago, approximately.

Yeah, same with me. Same with me. It's interesting. We must have been on the same radio, frequency of bit or something. Well, it's interesting. It's interesting. It had any idea how much you and I know that we've got a 95% overlap in our geeky world views and the things that the eclectic signature, it's just too similar to just blow off as a mere coincidence.

So I think we can know. Same radio. That is super fascinating. And I mean, the point that you're making about all of this, I mean, obviously there's a larger discussion as well about a field of knowledge that probably everyone could have access to, right? That maybe only certain do. And then what are the conditions to be able to get that access to it?

Yes, right? But the way you're starting to describe the self simulation theory, I would say it's freakishly similar to the way I describe it as well. Yes. And so we never even had this conversation. So we're going to be seeing a lot of sentences. I think yeah, yeah. So it tells there's some sort of proof positive just in that concept alone.

So please keep going. Super fascinating by this. So part of the self simulation hypothesis underpinnings and emergence theory, which is our version, our application of the self simulation hypothesis, is language theory. And so language for our listeners should not be thought of as just spoken languages.

Okay. Math is a language. Yeah. Math is a language. And again, a language is should be defined as a finite set of objects or symbols and rules on how you can relate them where there is syntactical freedom within the rules so that you can you're not just an algorithm playing out. So physics. Particle. That's what I was going to say.

I'm a linguist. I speak eight languages. Yeah. So I speak Korean, Japanese, Chinese, French, German, Spanish, English and Hebrew. Well, that's so that's pathetic, Robert. You only know eight languages. Why not 10 or 11? Just terrible lazy. Well, I didn't want to be I didn't want to be categorized as like one of those guys that works at the UN.

And that's all he does is translate. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that. But it's interesting because I saw math as a language. Yeah. Immediately. I saw it and it's very similar way you just described it. So that's really kind of freaking me out. The way I saw it was I learned a system for learning languages and the system was to learn the verbs.

So I learned 2000 verbs in any language to learn the language first because I knew I could be proficient if I knew at least 2000 verbs. I would not spend any time memorizing nouns or anything like that. But I would spend time learning the conjugations. Yeah. And you know, all the particles and all this type of stuff that would go along with the language.

And so when I started deeply diving into mathematics, I looked at it from the lens of language and I found that the words were like numbers, the verbs were the math constants, the verbs of action. You know, like I'm circling a, circling a diameter, for example, and the ING that we append on the end to make a noun into a gerund was like an irrational tail, right?

And then, and so then I thought, well, how many verbs do we know in a number of math constants that we actually, the dimensionless math constants that we actually know and understand? You know, if you include all the physics constants and those could hardly be characterized as dimensionless entirely because they all are based on at that time, at least I was thinking that they're all based on certain measurement systems, right?

Could be based on, you know, kilograms or seconds or meters or whatever. I later found out that even all those might actually be dimensionless too, which and we're living in a world of ratios. But I looked at it as we only know probably, you know, 20, you know, Fiegenbaum constant, you know, and a lot of those are derivations of the same ones that could define our world.

That's why I thought, I wonder how smart we would be if we knew 2000 verbs. Exactly. Literally 2000 verbs. And that that's how you could actually classify the advancement of a civilization would be how many verbs and how many discrete geometric forms doesn't actually understand and comprehend. Exactly. So I'm going to riff off your verb.

I'm going to look at that as a, as a synchronicity because I'd like to lay down these basics for the whole conversation. So I'd lay down the basic definition of the word language. Now I want to lay down the basic working definition of the word consciousness. And I'm going to use the concept of nouns and verbs.

So a false question would be looking at a wall clock and saying, well, what number comes first? The 10, 10 a.m. number or the 4 p.m. number. So you wouldn't want to ever answer that. You'd want to say, well, that's a false question. If you're putting it on the line and you tell me that the left side of the line is where the beginning is, then I can tell you what comes first in a sequence of numbers.

So it is a false question to ask, what does consciousness, what is consciousness? And what I mean by that is consciousness is not a noun. It is, consciousness is a flow, a process. It is a story in motion. Consciousness should be described by its verb forms. So the verb form of consciousness includes many equivalent verbs.

It includes the verb think. It includes the verb idea of to perceive and experience meaning. It is a constant story of awareness unfolding. And you might object by saying, well, clean, what about if I choose the state of consciousness of pure nothingness or everythingness with no duality. And I would say, is that not a choice of a state of awareness to be aware of non-duality, nothingness, or everythingness, or the void?

And if you admitted, well, I guess I did choose that. And I'd say, well, then that is yet another choice of a state of awareness that you have chosen to be in. And you may choose it another step to be aware of something something more finite or dualistic. So if we allow this soft softening of the meaning of consciousness to be extended out to the words meaning awareness thought.

And we don't have to grapple in and get too detailed about debating. We can just say there's also a bit of a mystery to it because consciousness itself emerges from such an enormous magnitude of complexity in complex systems that it becomes part of the class of problems that computer scientists describe as non-solvable.

There are unknowable problems in a finite universe that even if you use your NP-hard, there's NP-hard which is one class and then there's purely unsolvable. But it depends. So there's that. So now let me with those little definitions just for sake of the conversation, let me try to be concise and explain the self-simulation hypothesis because we've explained for your listeners the simulation hypothesis and how reasonable it is.

In other words, Elon Musk is very reasonable in deducing that at least there's a two out of three chance that were not in the one real world. But I had mentioned the insidious assumption of the ancient Greek spiritual tradition of materialism being baked into that question that I took you through. Because I was dishonest in how I asked the questions.

I said so therefore you believe, Robert, that there's only a one third at best chance that you are lucky enough to be in the one real reality because the other ones made of pure information, I implied that they were not real. So I implied that I am a materialist and I kind of tricked you to going along with that by not being honest enough to say and by the way there's this may be a false assumption that there is anything other than meaning or information to reality.

So now let's go to the contrasting self simulation hypothesis and I'll kind of do it with the same way. I'll just ask you to play dumb and answer questions and feel free to say probably or yes. So question one, even though even if you cannot describe it mathematically, physically, even if you can't prove it, are you willing to say that you are probably conscious, even if you can't fully define it?

Yes. So that means you think consciousness exists like it's a real thing in the reality. Okay, good. That's important. Me too. Second, do you think that your consciousness as an exceptionally smart human is anywhere remotely close to the upper limit of what consciousness can be either in form or magnitude within the laws of physics and quantum neurobiology that we know today, right?

We we probably would say no, we're not we're not thinking that we're at the apex, the upper limit of it all. No, definitely not. The more I learn, I feel the more I less actually know. All right, let me ask a third question. Are you willing to say you don't have a big problem with the adage from physics that says whatever is not strictly prohibited will occur given enough time.

I even think the things that are strictly prohibitive will occur given enough time. Okay. So then meet. Yes, I can go that way too, but but we can say that since the answer is yes to your question. Yes, definitely. Because we teed up the other one to say that, you know, given the laws of physics and quantum neurobiology, right, are we any should we believe we're anywhere near the upper limit, right?

And so we said no, and then we're saying, okay, sticking to the laws of physics and restricting ourselves in that way, this is the laws of physics as we know it today, which will probably be overturned, right? As they always are. So then we can say, yeah, given enough time, there's definitely far more advanced forms of consciousness and magnitudes of consciousness forward and time, and we can say that that probably can exist in our in our descendant tree and our descendants are mostly speciated away from us, right?

Like there's been 100 million species on the planet so far according to the standard biology evolutionary biology theories, and they all just branched off or speciated from one another. So our descendants will surely branch off and speciate from us, but we could still call them our descendants and they live obviously in the future.

And I think we could at least, I don't need to ask you to add this question to your list, but we'll just kind of say to our audience that you and I believe that there's some truth to Einstein's idea that the future past and present are equally real. Prior to his theory and the experimental demonstration, it was popular before 1905 to believe that the past no longer exists and the future obviously doesn't exist, and that was the old school view, and then we realized as backed by some experiments that it's bizarre, but the future actually exists.

And so too does the past continue to exist. So in that context, we can say right now, there are probably descendants in somewhere in in deep time or even near future time that are sophisticated enough to hold within their consciousness, whatever that word means, a simulation of themselves, the whole origin.

So now I'm going to ask you to let me run a simulation in your neural network. You might need to close your eyes because I'm going to ask you to play the game of Tic Tac Toe against yourself to the end and then announce to the audience and me whether X is or O's won. But first, I want to set up the metaphor to serve my purposes because what we work on is the concept metaphorically of game boards and games.

So the 64 squares on a checker board can allow you to play a bunch of games and games or algorithms. So you can play chess on it or you can play checkers and you can play a lot of other games, but they're different. The game board and the games are different. So for us, game boards are algebra's and represent certain types of algebra's with spaces that have points in them.

So for example, we can have a space in 2D that has the vertices, the little points that are where the lines cross on a checker board. And we can imagine that checker board going to infinity and having those periodic points arranged as they are. And that is a mathematical object called the Z2 lattice. And these lattices are often a part of the skeleton, if you will, of algebra's called leading algebra's that physicists use for physics.

So I'm going to ask you to hold within the substance of your consciousness a very, very small section of this infinite Z2 lattice, a tic-tac-toe board, just nine squares, three by three. And if you need to close your eyes, do it if you don't. But lay down the first, oh, don't tell us where it is, but you're going to have to hold it in your memory.

And then lay down the first X. And then lay down the next second, oh, and just play the game of tic-tac-toe out to the end and let us know whether X is or O's one. Okay. Okay. X is one. Excellent. You're smarter than me because I have to close my eyes to do it. And that's not surprising because you're very smart.

So now imagine in your descendant tree, a bigger consciousness can play on a higher-dimensional game board, such as the point set in eight dimensions of the E8 lead algebra's root lattice. It's very much like the checker board. It's just a periodic array of points in a space, right? Like you can take the checker board to 3D and you could like kind of rise it up into a tube with a little point inside of it.

And so this is no more complicated than that. It's just raising it up a few more dimensions to 8D. Now that's a game board. So a big consciousness like the board from Star Trek, right, a bigger consciousness, could in principle hold a much bigger section of a higher-dimensional game board. And it could run a game or a simple program that is more sophisticated than tic-tac-toe.

Certain names can produce probability distributions for how game quasi particles, which are ripples patterns, can emerge as the game plays out. Stephen Wolfram, a friend of mine, works a lot on these ideas of how simple programs can make shockingly sophisticated dynamic patterns. One example that some of the listeners here have probably seen is you can go on YouTube and Google like 4K fractal zoom.

And it takes you into this otherworldly system of patterns that never quite repeat. And if we showed our audience the tiny, tiny simple program, the little algorithm that generates that, they'd be blown away. They'd say, well, how can such a simple, simple little algorithm do that? And it comes from large quantities of iteration.

And that's what's happening with GPT-4 and the other large language models and the generative video like Sora and the generative music. All of this is artificial creativity that happens by taking an incredibly simple concept of the math of neural nets and just going nuts with the quantity of iterations.

And then you get emergent complexity. So long story short, the self-simulation hypothesis says consciousness seems to exist. So we probably don't need to argue too much about that because I think probably less than 1% of scientists would deny that they are conscious. Did you know that there's a new love affair with mathematics and geometry happening all around the world today?

People who once despise these subjects in high school are now finding they're falling in love with them. Do you know why? Because math without meaning is simply information. Whereas math with meaning is divine communication. My course is the etymology of number and the language of light guide you on a journey of self-discovery, sharpening your problem solving and pattern perceiving as well as analytical and creative thinking and unlocking your fullest polymathic potential and most importantly equating you with the mathematical language of the universe itself.

You will never see the you inverse the same again. To get started, I recommend the etymology of number, a four-part series that explores the evolution of numbers and their impact on fields like physics, chemistry, music and art. It is the embodiment of Leonardo da Vinci's encouragement to study the science of art and the art of science.

Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else. My second course series, The Language of Light, is a six-part series that builds on concepts from the first course and offers deeper insights into unified sciences, ancient wisdom, spirituality and their relevance to today. My courses are always fun and easy to understand.

They intertwine mathematics, music, art and consciousness and illuminate the mathematical connections that span all disciplines of science and art.

And so we can say consciousness exists. Consciousness will most likely get more powerful and we are probably not the upper limit. Consciousness can run simulations like you just ran the simulation of the tic-tac-toe game and the sophistication of the simulations linearly maps to the sophistication and the magnitude of the consciousness running the mental simulation.

So in that picture, we can run the same simulation that we agreed could be run in the simulation hypothesis that leads utterly realistic realities and we can also do it within a mental framework because we have evidence that computers exist, we have evidence that consciousness exists, we have evidence that consciousness can run photorealistic simulations.

So tonight I'll probably have seven dreams and I will be punked like my kids say by all seven of them meaning I will never stop in the middle of my dreams tonight and ask myself wait a minute, I know this is utterly realistic but am I dreaming? Is this just a mental simulation? I have done it and I've had lucid dreams but I probably won't do it tonight and I probably will not do it on this call with you Robert so far we've been on this call for many minutes and I have never once asked myself am I dreaming this as a mental simulation or is this a real call with Robert?

Because how would I know? And the reason I don't ask myself that is because I constantly get fooled punk by the utter realism of my mental simulations in dreams and I cannot tell the difference the way light triangulates off of a dream chandelier if there was any funkiness my pattern recognition ability would seem as wonky and I'd know but it's really accurate so long story short it currently dreams are outpacing man-made computer simulations for sheer realism but that's okay because in a very short period of time the simulations created by mankind and computers will be equivalently realistic so now you've got two horses candidates is reality if we believe in the simulation hypothesis is it a mental simulation like in the self simulation hypothesis because there's evidence for consciousness and no evidence that we are the upper limit and there's evidence that computers can run simulations and there's no evidence that they are at the upper limit of what they write so that's the self simulation hypothesis I'm going to go with saying that the self simulation hypothesis is more probable than the simulation hypothesis because the simulation hypothesis has insidiously baked into its bones the nasty little mistake of 5,000 year old mystical Greek materialist philosophy and I see no evidence for that I and quantum mechanics says boldly that reality is made of information but there is no there is no real information there is no world that is not made of information right yep so now I get to assimilate the paper so we publish the peer review paper in a physics journal it's our institute's most popular paper we've been around 15 years our teams our scientists are mostly PhD mathematicians computer scientists and physicists and what this crazy world view is and as Einstein said you know a theory needs to be just crazy enough to be true right in if it's right to limit and to kind of run of the mill probably that's an old school theory that needs to be overturned so this idea here is that we are living in a mental simulation within the mind of an emergent pan-consciousness substrate so when you imagine a pan-consciousness right that is essentially the idea like the Borg in Star Trek but you are one of those Borg so you're made of a countless billions of little animals that are like they are single-celled organisms they run from toxins they chase nutrients they make unpredictable choices they have babies and they go to the bathroom cells so your body is a vast city of cells performing different roles like customers and doctors and and they're stupid compared to you so run this is a sort of difficult to define quality that emerges and and and floats upon an ocean of trillions of these little animals down below the little animals live their little lives make their simple choices and they have very little idea that there's this godlike emergent Robertness right floating and steering them right steering your body to move left or do right or eat this or that and so so we can say that that's downright miraculous there's nothing in quantum mechanics that we know of that predicts that because we cannot use quantum mechanics to predict the probability of anything more complicated than a hydrogen atom we can't actually apply quantum mechanics mathematically to a DNA molecule or a calcium atom and much less you know Robert's entire complex system so but we do have a lot of authors who have explained that the probability for life and Robertness to emerge just by quantum mechanics is is probably a snowball's chance in hell and yet here we are so with the self simulation hypothesis we require another implication of experiment and quantum mechanics which is retro causality so at the classic Newtonian view we say that if event a caused event b it would be impossible or illogical for event b to have caused event a in quantum mechanics the way the math works in quantum mechanics is it goes both directions in time so it says if event a caused event b it allows just mathematically for event b to cause a in a simultaneous co-creation then there's experiments that corrupt that and it's hard to accept because the world is like the quantum eraser yeah quantum eraser of neural slit is a good example of we yeah John Wheeler invented that experiment and the technology to demonstrate it did not emerge until after he had died I think in the 90s yeah and he would he would be happy to find out that he is his experiment turned out to be you know a positive or true when when when conducted so long story short just for my views or viewers but that basically means is that we all kind of understand the notion that probably the past and the present has something to do with the future that's right and what what we're talking about here is what Cleo is saying as well is that the future also determines the past yes because we have an electron positron coupling right and and this is I think you've probably heard about this experiment I'm not sure the status is the one that they were going to do at University of Portsmouth on annihilation of gamma photon annihilation using electron positron coupling to basically annihilate each other and prove information theory which which definitely seems like an interesting experiment I don't know if they've done it yet or not yeah I know they were going to do it it's fast so with retro we call this retro causality it just means you know causality coming from the future acting on the past but it doesn't mean that we deny normal forward causality now you take both causality because it's a two-way street at least the guitar it's a guitar string it's a feeding loop yeah it's a co-creation between future and past I mean let's personify it let's agree that that Einstein is correct and that there's a version that Robert exists tomorrow on Sunday right we're recording this on Saturday and the probability that you're going to die tonight is exceedingly low which makes the probability that Robert exists on Sunday tomorrow exceedingly high and so the Robert tomorrow in this viewpoint is subtly influencing the Robert of the past which is today but the Robert of the past is right now nodding his head in agreement which is changing the Robert of the future every little thing that the Robert of today does changes Robert tomorrow and vice versa so they are in a co-creative jam session in a sense co-creating each other and if all of reality from a particle system like you just described to a human complex system of two versions at different locations in time but where does it end what about the Robert on Monday what about Robert as an old man of wise old man of age you know 70 they're all they're all co-influencing each other they can be manipulated you can minimize or dampen the influence from one of these other influences forward or backwards in time you can dampen and you can upregulate right the power or the amplitude of that influence so what I have done is I have zeroed in on aspects or pathways in the probability distribution forward in time the ones that I like or the ones that I sense are pulling like strange tractors on me and I embrace them and I seek to resonate with them and in so doing to upregulate the probability like amplitude and so that is a way that you can participate in the co-creation of reality and your own life or your scientific project or your business project you dial in to those pathways forward you can just use your imagination to do it and you fixate on that and you and you just pretend what it would feel like to literally couple quantum couple or inter resonate and in so doing you tweak the quantum probabilities of flowing down those pathways right kind of you can imagine your favorite TV science fiction show about many worlds right all these many worlds of quantum and then and then in this sense it's kind of like picking one of those many world pathways that are allowed in quantum mechanics and using a kind of mental connection to to create the guitar string of the feedback loop and then that actually makes its way down to the particle level where quantum particles are having higher magnitudes of quantum resonance and coupling so that so finishing the explanation of the self-simulation hypothesis so we can talk about emergence theory one could say that it is agnostic to what the actual mathematical approaches and the physics that can be applied it's an open cosmology that allows lots of models like what we work on emergence theory so so let me cap it off the self-simulation hypothesis is like a line that you say event a like the big bang led to the early hydrogen universe right led to the universe of just suns before supernova so there weren't any other atoms in the universe other than hydrogen mostly and then supernova started to happen around here and that spewed out about a hundred different types of atoms like iron and then molecules could emerge like you know DNA and simpler molecules like H2O and it just keeps going and it gets more and more and more complex life emerges eventually societies stock markets this heavy conversation we're having so and now so then on that linear spectrum we get to this object here which is really simple like the game board the mathematical game board and the mathematical game and then this way up here robertness which we gave as an example of something wickedly complex that float emerges from an ocean and then beyond robert these higher magnitude and even different forms of consciousness where we admit that eventually you get to one that was capable of holding the game board in the game and the whole evolution playing out as a self-simulation and all we have to do to make sense of this is give up the question what comes first the chicken or the egg the the question of what comes first was never meant to be answered it was a parable to explain what a false question is you got on my wall clock we don't ask what comes first on the circle but 10 am or the 3 pm that's a false question they're on a circle so if we take this if we reject linear causality and there's experiments quantum mechanical experiments that allow us to reject it as scientists and we just wrap that line in a circle we have the metaphor of the oral boros so the oral boros is a symbol that showed up in countless the snake eating its tail yeah and and and the tail represents the thinnest tip at one skin sale that's it's not very complicated it's not very big and then as you get all the way up to the head it's the biggest and most complicated part of the snake and so an emerge in self-simulation hypothesis we can ask well where does the game board the math game board and the algorithm at the origin where did that come from where does it live and we say oh that comes from lives within and emerged from the mind of God and we could say well where does the mind of God come from follow follow what we know about evolutionary biology like you get to ridiculously abstract thinking creative engines like like Robert and then you and then you go beyond that and you don't have to subscribe to the old school idea that a consciousness like Robert can only exist in carbon based matter why can't Robert consciousness patterns exist in the electromagnetic spectrum why can't it exist in some exotic topological form of physics like Leonard Sussmann's idea or the periodic table of elements thank you so that's it so it's just the wrapping of that linear hierarchy into a circle and then you can ask oh the self-simulating pan-consciousness substrate which is like God right I'm not trying to be religious I'm just saying it it's more probable than not that higher and higher levels of consciousness can self-organize in the universe and eventually you get to ones they can do simulations better than tic-tac-toe and even simulations better than the dreams that keep punking me because they're way more complex than tic-tac-toe I know you have some trippy dreams man I'm quite sure you have some you have some wild I can see you waking up and going that was a trip yes that happens to me all the time by the way and by the way unlike what you said for you I was thinking during this course of this conversation not even wondering I'm like whoa this is a trippy simulation as it's 144 right now we so we need to do that we all need to do that more often we need to stop and ask in our dreams because if you get used to stopping and asking if you're dreaming like if you train yourself to ask I do it all the time yeah you're gonna have more lucid dreams and if you can have a little dream you can do some really cool stuff so I had this weird experience this this week I spent the week in Austin Texas I stayed at the house of a pretty well-known actor by the name of Adrian Grinier who was the guy who played the lead character on one of my favorite TV shows of all-time entourage oh yeah and and so I spent the weekend at his house and it's incredibly gracious host but it was so bizarre for me because I've been studying alchemy and I'm kind of a student of hermetic wisdom and I happen to believe that the self-simulation hypothesis that you are putting forward here is it has been taught for millennia from ancient times to today just using different words and you know the very first principle of hermetic wisdom is the universe is mental the all is mental yeah and and I think it's such a powerful thing so I teach hermetic wisdom and I get to his place and this whole last you know a few weeks I've been really intrigued by the concept of philosopher stone and turning the suffering of negative experiences into the evolution the gold of evolution in our soul so soul evolution love it and and so I arrive at his ranch he's got a beautiful ranch the name of the ranch is kinsugi now kinsugi you may recognize it's a japanese word for making this type of pottery of broken pieces of pottery oh yeah put back together they take all the broken parts and then they weld it back together with gold yes something beautiful from something broken something beautiful from something broken and to me that's the hero's journey that you know I believe is the foundational basis of the entire self-simulation theory that you're talking about right and I believe that we have a higher self and the higher self is basically decided for us to experience this division of oneness so that it can perceive itself through our eyes that are totally unique that nobody else would ever have had in the past and no one will ever have again because we have our own unique conditioning biases associated with it so even though we think that what happens to us is what happened to us it's not it's what we believe happen to us that actually happens to us in our minds it creates an emotional state and then those emotions feed some larger for lack of a better term AI which is not really an AI it's just intelligent it's feeding back to this one consciousness and we are like a mirror for that consciousness and so and that mirror happens right at fine structure constant you know one one over one thirty seven I love it to me to me it's like we have been selected in a way yeah to experience this lower dimensional or dimensionally limited avatar state we are in a dimensionally limited avatar state because if you and I were omniscient I'm nip it and I'm omnipresent we could never play poker and have it be fun yes right I would know the hand you're gonna be dealt you would know the hand I'm gonna be dealt yeah kind of boring yeah the only game that would make sense in the self-simulation hypothesis would be a game where we limited our powers and the whole idea was to go back and realize that we had them all along the one divides itself into the many simply for the joy of perceiving itself through our unique eyes of perception and then becoming one again it's like breathing now let me disclose where the self-simulation hypothesis might bother some people and I think it's good to it's good to face something that bothers you so that you can be a good uh discovering discoverer in this reality and be a good scientist because a good scientist doubts everything even their own beliefs and always looks to double check themselves to see if they're missing something so there is baked in especially for us people in the west a Judeo-Christian type of belief system which is also baked into the Islamic belief systems that says essentially there is this god character and god was in a good mood thank goodness thank god god was in a good mood and god blessed reality with the gift of reality or creation and it certainly didn't need us to be it to be to to become itself I do not believe in that I believe in a oneness universe where god self-actualizes itself from fundamentally simple things down at the most boring geeky level of the math game board and the math game and then that creates a higher archy of information that is built on sacred geometry because the the e8 root lattice which is the largest exceptionally algebra is nothing more complicated than a higher-dimensional version of this sacred geometry and I just use sacred geometry to be poetic and because that's what I like to to draw correlations but long story short this this idea is sometimes rejected by spiritual people who have been who feel it sacrilegious for me to say that god itself in this worldview is good enough to be god-like without being infinite because if something is infinite if a consciousness were infinite then there would be nothing new under the sun there would be nothing novel that it could learn it could not expand it could not grow but a collective consciousness substrate as the computational substrate that is itself eternally reaching toward the infinite is a more beautiful concept that is god-like and spiritual like and look it's kind of like money if you had a trillion dollars it's about the same as an infinite amount of money because you know I would I don't I'm not going to live long enough to spend a trillion if I even tried right so the point is is a god that is trillions upon trillions upon trillions of times more conscious and expansive and non-local than me I don't even you know right like the word infinity itself is an abstraction it implies that you can't even add one more little unit or increment two times infinity is still infinity thank you so long story short that's the one disclosure but I think it's a beautiful realization for me that as a former materialist atheist that now I I actually do have a viewpoint that is feeling helpful to my life like the way spiritual things do but it went through the lens of my reasoning my knowledge my pursuit of knowledge and my doubt and and all it requires is that this god-like thing not be outside of creation and reality it be it's part of it and like it's degraded yeah and it's evolved universe it evolved so so that's that so now if you want robber I can I can I'll summarize that whole thing in a sentence where in the self-simulation hypothesis reality follows the first of the hermetic principles all is thought and thought is synonymous with consciousness because it's kind of and so so if it's thought it's kind of like the verb form of the noun consciousness same thing to me all is thought and and so we have two classes of thought in self-simulation what we call emergent physical information white EP and EP comes in a hierarchy that's evolutionary so EP1 would be a photon a neutrino okay EP2 would be a nucleon a proton and it goes up so it's EP123 to end and then somewhere at very complex systems of physicality or EP intelligence comes out of animals like you and I and this intelligence is not part of EP like when I think of irony right that is not part of EP yes my mind my neural network itself emerges from EP right and EP is helpful for our listeners to be thought of as geometric right yeah imagine tiny tiny plonk scale the plonk scale is the pixelated scale for physicists where you cannot divide a moment to be less than the plonk moment and you cannot divide a volume to be less than the plonk volume they are very very very small and everything physical is emergent from those constructions so that's that's so EP physicality is made of mathematical information in the space of geometry vectors angles things like that and then EC is a bit more ineffable and it's more abstract and a little bit less knowable and it emerges on the ocean of EP and then eventually we find well where did EP come from like where did this geometry or these thoughts and these structures of particles electrons come from and that's the oral boroughs well that came from the EC but the EC has to be smarter than us like like we're damn smart right but I think to make a full blown model realistic or plausible you have to imagine somewhere in our descendant tree and it may not be that far away as things can exponentially evolve um so that's that and then then it gets it and then what's really excites me in what drives my life and my mission and how I want to spend my money you know after I sell some of the stock in my company and just lean in with the rest of my life to communicate and develop emergence theory um so I so I could start but this is your podcast so I have to ask with what you suggest but I could I could start by telling your listeners what the axioms or the the assumptions the starting assumptions are of emergence theory um so okay so then so first yeah yeah go ahead and take us through the starting assumptions of emergence theory okay and and don't be afraid to connect it you know as much as you feel helpful to uh things like you know hermetic frameworks please oh thank you well then the first one I'll start with the their seven hermetic principles um and so there was a character in ancient literature called hermese and this seems to be a different name for the other character called thoth and this character also kind of can I just ask a quick question yeah when when did you start getting into the whole hermetic thing because I'd be interested to hear how you got pulled into this line of of philosophical thought well this is something that um even hesitant to say on a podcast that's going to get published on the internet but I'm going to do it anyway because I don't want to be judged too much I try to um appeal to atheist materialist scientists because my goal is to bridge the world of modern of fundamental physics with the intuitions that more than 50% of Americans have had where they have claimed to have experienced anomalous cognitive experiences in consciousness so so I'm going to do it anyway though rubber uh go right ahead and and so um at the beginning of this so I call this 15 years of my life the mission right the mission is just the unification of spirit and matter but not writing a popular audience book that mashes up phrases like quantum with spiritual words you know uh there's a lot of ex like guys like depock Chopra and and who's a friend of mine and others who do a great job of that I kind of want to put more teeth in it because I want to scoop up more materialist atheist like I used to be into this exploration uh if they're open-minded and so anyway so 15 years ago is when it started and um and and and that first year uh I decided to go to this workshop by this guy how old are you so I'm I'm 58 and I was 44 at that time yeah I I'm I turn 55 in in about two weeks okay so very similar age and we both had this activation if you will into our memories at the same time and about the same time so I so I'm tuned into that radio station concepts like sacred geometry or just geometry in general I don't have to say sacred but this was coming up as I was tuned into this proverbial radio station that it's funny you say that because for myself I used to say yeah I liked geometry I was always good at it and I'm like but what makes it sacred exactly and I think it's just sacred thing and I think it's just sacred now that I 15 years later realize that the symbolism we talked about symbols right the symbolism that nature uses for this self-simulation are are uh what we call vectors so if I take an equilateral triangle right it's just three lines but down here at one vertex this is a vector this is two vectors right here and here and so uh a tetrahedron a square right these are made of these vectors so and this is the language of physicists physicists will often use vector altrubrans so uh long story short this was um so so that would be sacred in other words if a very ground of reality is thought and the fundamental thoughts are these geometric thoughts like the idea of uh of a shape or an angle like when you think of square that's very mathematical object but it's also when you're thinking of it or visualizing it's just an object within your consciousness at that yeah all right so this is the stuff this is the part that I had that I have some reluctance to share so I'll be quick so this guy named who's an American who gave himself a new name like a lot of new age guys do he calls himself Drunvalo Malchezadek yeah I know Drunvalo yeah so I had never heard of him because I I I was just going through this phase transition at that time in 2009 but it talked about geometry and it was a lot of the geometry that was coming through in this whatever these experiences I was having so I grabbed some of my crew my employees and I say all right well let's fly out to you know Sedona and uh and let's go to this guy's workshop he's talking about this geometry stuff so we go out and you know met him him and I started kind of resonating finishing each other sentences he invited himself out to my house I live in Topanga California he comes out a couple weeks after his workshop in Sedona and he asks you know we go on a hike and he asks hey do you want to uh let me put you under a light hypnosis and I said yeah but why and he says you know I don't know we could just kind of get to the core of what this experience is for that's happening to you and I said that sounds fun let's do that so he he does some light standard hypnosis on me and you know so then that helps me get into a hypnagogic state where you kind of let your mind just be a little bit more expansive um and uh and in that hypnagogic state he says this weird question who are you right like it kind of implies like are you being influenced by something is there a core element is there a sole element whatever I didn't know what it meant but it was something like that and I'm in a hypnagogic state so I'm not like in a normal state and and and and and my mouth is trying to move my eyes are closed and I and I start I say this I pronounce this word troth thoth now at the time I had never read any of the literature so I had never been exposed to any of this stuff at that point because I just thought all this was bullshit like I'm a materialist atheist so why would I ever pay attention to any of these ideas and this ancient stuff whether it's Egypt or any of that stuff from where Hermes thought all this stuff all that's bullshit too right the totally closed-minded mentality so I just didn't know it so then so then later he said it sounded like you were pronouncing the word thoth and do you know who that is I said never heard of it it sounded like a it sounded like a mispronunciation so I was like maybe it's troth you know because you want to put a TR after a lot of anger or yeah doing does like is it trothoth anyway so I don't I I have a viewpoint that from the self-simulation hypothesis that different gistults of consciousness different entities living in the future living in the past it all bleeds together in a kind of non-local field where different where you can dial in different magnitudes or intensities of these inner inner bleeding together so I guess the way I'm describing it is like oh of course I'm not thoth I'm Clee Irwin I like I was born in 1965 I got my problems I'm you know my my idiosyncrasies I'm not thoth or Hermes but I for whatever reason was able or willing at a subconscious level to be permeated a little bit or influenced by that gistult of thought and this was a form of thought from ancient periods where it is as though at different cycles of time in the last many thousands of years there have been these sweet spots in time where humanity had the ability to rigorously connect this idea of the unification of spirit and matter all theories of mind ideas with all theories of physics but this last wave and a lot of people believe that these waves are part of these cycles that relate to real physical cycles as our star system rotates around this particular arm of the Milky Way galaxy and other star systems and and it's which by the way is the Orion arm yeah that's right the Orion arm and it's fascinating because for for Egyptologists and people who study Mayan and all these connections it's really fascinating because these ancient people did not have the astrophysical technology to measure 26,000 year cycles like their cultures didn't even last that long so how in the world through the astronomy of that day that they got this knowledge of this cycle around Orion I think they had to do it with a little bit of psychic ability for lack of a better word I don't think it was solely just their math at the time I think it was a mix of some clever math at the time but I think that they got some of that clever math by intuitions or you know call it language you know so anyway so long story short I believe Robert that at different periods of time we have these peaks in the field let's call it let's use a geeky word in the in the quantum field we have phases that relate to the cycles of our solar system to this local part of the Milky Way galaxy that are well understood by astronomers and they may correlate to things that are less well understood where the potentiation for an expansion of science mathematics and awareness and knowledge is heightened and then it goes and then it subsides and you got to wait till the next you know cycle this is what we we've called historically renaissance periods yes a period of the quickening right is another one of the phrase so we're in the eliminations yes so long story short I believe that the first so the first of the axioms is all is thought that's the first of a hermetic or thought based principles so for the listeners the idea that these two characters are somehow the same consciousness in and may have existed in in human forms at different times at the Egyptian level 4,000 years ago the entity or the consciousness which may or may not have been embodied in a real human that's called thoth thoth and then at a later epic more close to our western civilization period we have this up this character that shows up named hermies HERMES and so the the seven hermetic principles the first one is all is thought which is the big which is the basis of the self-simulation hypothesis and it's also what quantum mechanics implies where it says everything is information but information cannot exist without an entity capable of actualizing it into meaning because information is meaning conveyed by symbolism so the next axioms and axioms for the listeners are just assumptions right so we have to start somewhere and when we build a physics theory or a mathematical proof we start somewhere and these are the axioms the second place that is an axiom of starting is the axiom of finiteness so one must make a choice if they're going to build up a cosmology do you think that reality is infinite and are you even able as a layperson to define what mathematicians mean when they say infinity right not you Robert but I'm saying one has to ask and so without getting into that I want to say that most physicists agree in the big bang cosmology and in that cosmology it is not a cosmology that says reality is infinite now some physicists have models that say it's infinite so let's just for now agree that it is beautiful to say that reality is infinitely reaching toward the infinite but hasn't quite arrived and that means there that the adage that there is nothing new under the sun is false and that there is always opportunity for learning new humor right new new ideas creativity is never ending all right so now the axiom of finiteness is going to lead us to a few interesting places it not only means that reality cannot be finite and that the pan consciousness godlike you know emergent substrate is not quite infinite but always growing but it also means that in any small volume of reality like a cubic inch you cannot have an infinity of points because of the axiom of finiteness and that leads to the idea that physicists call discrete so we say that reality is discrete which means pixelated that time and volume cannot be smaller than the plonk time and volume and this is going to lead us into computer theory soon but first let me get to the code theoretic axiom which is the third of our axioms and that is a really simple axiom it says reality is made of language and earlier all we talked about how quantum mechanics is a formally a language mathematics is a language a lot of physicists think reality is made of math the information of math and that's a language we're trafficking in language you could you could by the way be raised in a forest and never have been exposed to a natural language like English and your thoughts will have a language algebraic language kind of form in other words you'll have verb thoughts you'll have noun thoughts you'll have thoughts conjunctions that are you know I have two rocks instead of one in that in that creates what we call a generalized algebra so all the thought is is is is is is is an algebraic has this generalized algebraic form that all languages have it's very general now so if everything is code language and reality is finite and everything is made of thought which is finite then it leads us to the fourth axiom which was also published in I believe the code theoretic axiom paper and that's called the principle of efficient language it's really simple it simply says if reality is made of thought in the mind of an emergent pan-consciousness computational substrate in the self-simulation hypothesis and if it is finite it means it's resource it's it's consciousness no matter how vast is finite and its goal seems to be to create as much of itself with this little of itself as possible because that just means that you can become a conservationist yeah it means you could be you could be a bigger consciousness over over the same resource of of finite thought or consciousness and you can and you can expand faster so the principle of efficient language is very helpful because for us at our scientific institute it allows us to narrow down the mathematical possibilities and the computational simple programs that we speculate reality is is built on so the next the fifth axiom is also something that we already talked about and that is the idea of retro causality or the guitar the guitar string or the oral boroughs the strange loop and in our paper we call it a strange loop and that is this would be the hermetic principle of cause and effect you got it cause and effect between past and future and and and that's it so with those with those six axioms we can get into explaining a justifying a little bit on on why we picked the this eight-dimensional crystal that's based on the largest I didn't I have no idea that I guess you've certainly never published this that hermetic principles had such a big played such a big role in and how you guys at least constructed mentally yeah the the concept of the E8 lattice and and emergence theory they didn't they indirectly they they some they may have subconsciously done but unfortunately or fortunately I didn't even know what the hermetic principles were until a couple years ago when I had that experience with Trunvalo 15 years ago I just never bothered to get around to looking up who the heck hermese was and what the hermetic principles were but I was encouraged and happy that older guys many years ago had kind of deduced that this idea that reality is made of is made of thought and that and and and and then I saw oh they were tuned into the same radio station right so this metaphor of tuning in is uh is a big deal yeah we're definitely tuned in there with same radio station because literally all of my work all of it has comes from that fountain love it and I've published like seven books now on like math it's all new mathematics I'll send you a copy of phylo math love it my book and uh it's basically the geometric unification of number um and and basically all of our reality and I'll definitely send you a copy of that but the entire thesis of all of my work and even my television show I have a show called code x on gaya and this year's the second season is called metatron revealed and metatron's just another name for thoth yes love it well listen so one of the little a little segue um in like the second or first year of bus fifteen year mission my 10-year old son uh claimed to be able to move his body around his mind around like a ghost now I was just coming off a lifetime of the materialist atheist thing even though my reality was being shattered at that time uh you know with a new paradigm um I had a hard time believing my son his name is hailey so I said this is the son that I met is this the son that I met at the starting at and so he's low older now but hailey um I said hailey look do you mind if I test you to see if it's real he says okay and I said all right good stay here we were in a vacation rental in Turks and Kiko's at that time it was a big four five thousand foot house um so I get a key huh yep were you at parent key oh gosh I don't remember I just know it was a way vacation rental called star gayser in in Turks and Kiko's and it was such a cool property so I go I I I tell Hailey stay there you was just sitting on a mat in a in a room and I go to some other random part of the house and open the door to some bathroom and I see on the right side of the bathroom sink an old a basket of about fifty old pens markers pencils so I ran I just jab my hand in there pull out a red marker randomly stick it on the left side of the desk you know close the door walk way over to the other side of the house hailey sitting exactly where I left him I said all right son what did I just do he closes his eyes and he says you went into a bathroom somewhere on the other side of the house and you put a red marker on the left side of the sink so uh so I'm like okay by the way that's how they test Tibetan monks Buddhist monks on whether or not they're ready to go through the next levels of of Lama ship yeah they don't test them on their ability to predict the future they test them on what happened in the past that they were not witness to and whether they could astral project their consciousness so that they could perceive it yeah so I didn't I still didn't believe it and of course after testing him you know a dozen more times with different versions of that trick then I became convinced that um he actually did somehow leave his body like a ghost and was moving around the house so then I said all right I want you to teach me how to do that and this is where I started making shit up rubber so I I I had remembered uh the the children's story from childhood of Peter Pan uh and how they'd have their shadow body and they would like pull it up so I said here's what we're gonna do Haley and I was way too confident I said now I'm gonna sit here across from you while you leave your body and I am going to raise up my mental arm my imaginary spirit arm I'm gonna raise it up right so I'm starting to believe that this is real because I'm literally telling him what he has to do now I need you to come float over my body like a ghost and grab my mental spirit arm and lift me out of my body so that you can take me around to fly around like a ghost he says that's very doable no problem so I'm sitting there with my eyes closed I'm stretching out my imaginary arm with great strain waiting for my kid to float above my head and pull me up like a ghost out of my body so then um it doesn't happen but what I did feel is hard to explain I felt a palpation under my right armpit as though somebody like poked me with their fingertip and then um and then I saw a light like you know if you touch your eyeball lightly it makes like a little light like you can see a little light like just touch your eyeball right so I kind of saw that in my mind's eye but somehow superimposed over um where in my armpit I felt that palpation I didn't mention anything about it because I get you know you get little muscle you know palpation kind of feelings all the time um I mean not all the time but I didn't feel I didn't I didn't think anything of it so then I open my eyes I look across at him and I blame him jokingly for not pulling me out of my body I said you didn't do it Hayley what happened man and he says he says Dada I tried but you were too heavy so I improvised and I grabbed you under the right armpit and I tried to yank you up and you were still too heavy I'm sorry so then I realized well maybe that palpation I felt at that moment under my right armpit kind of was a little bit of a mind over matter telekinesis kind of effect and uh long story short since then I've personally done remote viewing I've done a little bit of mind over matter uh stuff less frequently uh and I have um seen it in peer review papers that I was surprised there were even out there from legit universities I've seen it with many friends family members I have come to realize that I was flat out wrong about my Newtonian physics based materialist atheist point of view turns out that consciousness is apparently able to exist without being tethered necessarily to a human animal body because of that experience so so now so with so with so with the axioms we now have this whole framework and the one where I want to drill into is the principle of efficient language because this in some sense is what makes the difference between what we work on called emergence theory which involves certain mathematics and computer theory stuff versus the more agnostic cosmological framework of the self simulation hypothesis where you can look in lots of different models and math and viewpoints so it's all about bang for the buck so mathematicians are always looking for a more compact equation uh to use less symbolism to explain the same thing computer coders in silicon valley can get paid a million dollars a year if they are rock star algorithm compression algorithm writers in other words if you can figure out a way to write an algorithm in in a computer code that is uh takes less symbols than the former best algorithm then you just save a lot of electricity for your boss google or whoever it is so there's a lot of things uh a double entendre in poetry right just minimize symbolism maximize the uh the meaning output so this reality because it's finite because um it wants to become more conscious bigger conscious more evolution more experience with less symbolism and this will be where i'll have to just ask your readers to give me uh i don't know to just kind of say okay maybe because it will be hard for me to get into the mathematics very deeply of why the eight-dimensional crystal is the maximally powerful um algebra um that can describe spin and all of the facts of particle physics that that we have and um and then we have this other concept of the qubit so this is a fun one because it's easy to explain but it's super deep and foundational so let's imagine um a universe of all thought and a universe that's pixelated like there is an irreducible letter right we we traffic in english and the irreducible symbol is is one of these 26 letters right and you can get into bytes which are eight bits but you can't get any lower than a bit in that type of code system so what then in a reality that follows the code theoretic axiom everything is language or code and follows the axiom everything's finite and so you want to get down to reductionism of the simplest symbol so but this now becomes the simplest thought what is the simplest thought that can be the letter level proverbial letter of a universe of all thought so for mathematicians the simplest thought is the empty set and when you get to thoughts like love that's a complicated thought it's definitely not a simple thought right and so the in the we talked about ep and ec earlier so no form of ec would qualify as the simplest possible thought ep is always made of math math thought math thoughts like your tic-tac-toe experience so in the universe of math thoughts the simplest thought is the empty set and a set is just an abstract collection of thoughts or objects that can be mathematically defined there's a type of set theory called zermelo frankle set theory which is more restrictive and it says oh by the way mathematicians claim that the ground of all mathematics is set theory okay so this is why they would say that the simplest thought in mathematics is the empty set zermelo and frankle came along with zf set theory and they said we have a restrictive form of set theory where the elements or members of a set have to be numbers and they can't just be any number they have to be integers like one two three four yeah so I introduced a paper into the literature called toward the unification of physics and number theory a few years ago and we introduced formally a new form of integer called simplex integers so simplex a three simplex I'm sorry a two simplex is an equilateral triangle like that behind me in blue on my wall and so it represents so it's a simplex integer and it represents the counting number or integer three because it has three points so a zero simplex is a point and a point is a very simple thought it has no substructure no internal information no dimension it has very very little of anything it's a point that's a one simplex in zf set theory it can be seen as the set of one element because now these simplex integers are formally adopted into the math literature as a new form of integer and then obviously the empty set in zf set theory using simplex integers would be the absence of the point so you can think of the point being there recognized or on as one the set of one element and then you can switch hit as a bit and you can say no now I don't see it or I don't recognize it it's not here now it's the empty set so you modulate between the set of one element as the number one which is in the form of a point because we want to work in geometry and the empty set the point is not there it's off so imagine that it would take a quantity of this precious resource of the finite universal consciousness to hold the choice so the idea or the thought is a bit that means hey I got to decide binary I got to make a decision of on or off but before I make a decision it's going to cost me x amount of my consciousness to hold the decision right I have to understand the empty set as nothing I have to understand the set of one as on as a point a zero simplex as a point and I've not made the choice yet so in order to make the choice I have to hold the choice right right and let's call the amount of the amount of consciousness that it takes to do that let's just call it one or x okay so in order to then make the choice that takes more consciousness in other words if you say clear come over to my house next weekend and I'm going to give you a choice of chocolate or strawberry ice cream you got to make a choice but don't make it yet just hold the idea of the choice all week all the weekend now then if I get to the weekend and I have to execute my choice that's going to take x plus another amount of consciousness so isn't it better for a universe concerned with the principle of efficient language to not make a choice until it has to make the choice because in that case holding the choice of on or off point on point off requires only x amount of consciousness but once it makes the choice it has to use x plus the extra amount of consciousness to make the choice so this is a deep philosophical and axiomatic reason why in the heck reality would be based on the qubit because the only difference between a qubit and a bit is that with a qubit you don't have to make the choice you have three possible states choose it to be on choose it to be off you're both or or don't or don't make or or live in an undecided state yeah until you do it but that's cheaper use less consciousness so it's kind of cool I mean doesn't that also explain wave particle duality in a way it does and and and it's and I'd love to say something about so Carver Mead was a very famous physicist and he was one of the first authors to you know describe what I think a lot of physicists today would agree on and and I think maybe your listeners would love hearing this because it gets confusing when you hear wave particle duality okay the quantum mechanics says everything is information and the information that we mean is a probability distribution right that if you know we knew the state of some particles in DNA or two electrons whatever we can then plug all that information into Schrodinger's quantum wave function and calculated out and it gives this spread of countless possibilities of how it could evolve over time where all of the ways have a non-zero probability but somehow trillions of times higher probability than other ways all right in what case would it go from an abstract information only wave of probabilities to something like a particle the answer is never right it never goes to a particle and the reason it can never go to a particle is because even in principle we cannot measure down to the resolution of the Planck moment or the Planck volume that is in order for it to actually go to a probability of 100 percent that the particle is here at this XYZ coordinate at this exact time explaining the the measurement problem in APR that's right it lenses in other words when you observe the particle to be hitting uh so in in the double slit experiment we have a screen and the screen has electronics that will allow you to detect where right on the screen a particle like an electron hit it what that's fired from an electron gun and then you have a timer like a clock and that'll tell you when it hit so the problem is when we see it hit okay the best resolution that mankind has is with an electron microscope so that gives us a square area on the screen that is 10 to the 23 Planck lengths by 10 to the 23 Planck lengths uh that is 10 with 23 zeros after it we know it hit somewhere in that square angstrom but science technology does not allow us to know where in that 10 to the 23 by 10 to the 23 Planck squares that it hit you cannot know so what happens is the quantum formalism the quantum mechanics says oh he has knowledge that it hit somewhere in this square so it rewrites the wave function to say that it definitely did not hit over here over here or over here but we don't know where it hits here so it lenses the probabilities from a very broad probability space to a narrower but never to to one specific coordinate where all the others are zero and that one is just a hundred percent and that means that very rigorously no measurement has ever been done that can actually collapse it down to its particle state it was in a wave state it's a wave of probabilities in that example and that's with an electron microscope by the way if you're just using your eyeballs it's even a bigger spread of probabilities and when it's in a spread of two or more probabilities that's when we say it's in the wave form versus the particle form so there never is a collapse of the wave function proper where it goes to the classical state and where one could say that oh now it's not just information in the probability spread now it's somehow real physicalism it actually never goes there and even if we had better equipment it still couldn't go there because there's something called you know the uncertainty principle which is a neat part of quantum mechanics Heisenberg yeah heisenberg so I have a I presented slightly different but related theory to this in number theory and one of the things that I discovered was that if you'd look at the reciprocal value for prime numbers they have a unique characteristic that all of them have once you get above the number five so for every prime number above five their reciprocal values will always sum to a number that will sum to the number nine in their periods so for example one over seven is 0.142857 and those six digits repeat infinitely right 142857 if you add up 142857 it equals 27 and 2 plus 7 equals 9 so I discovered that in mod 9 analysis every prime number has this characteristic in its reciprocal value and of course that characteristic has some significance because it's always represented in the form of a sine cosine wave so in the reciprocal value of the prime number it has literally a sine cosine relationship the other thing I found was that for numbers that are semi prime numbers that were made by multiplying two prime numbers together you end up with the same phenomenon as long as the numbers that created those numbers were also as prime numbers greater than three so you could start with five so then I posited a new form of number called quasi prime number that carried the characteristics they were like the children of prime numbers but not semi prime numbers because semi prime could be divisible by two and three these are quasi prime numbers that are divisible by only primes that are greater than five and they have this unique characteristic that their reciprocal period value also sums to nine so I created a table that then shows like a wave distribution of you've got numbers that are highly composite so divisible by lots of prime numbers or lots of numbers right doesn't have to be prime and then highly non-composite so these would be prime numbers and I called the numbers because they happen to have a unique characteristic that we use them for all of our time measurements so they're all in the base 12 so because they've got these unique you know 12 has twice the number of factors than 10 does for example so 60 is the most highly composite number for its scale of number 5,040 is a very highly composite number as well and there's geometric relationships for all these so my what I was able to show and put forward was the nature that every number has it in its reciprocal value which of course is going to be related back to the Niels Bohr atom model which basically shows that the relationship between hydrogen its frequency and its resonance characteristics in light are literally lambda and 1 over lambda x and 1 over x through its absorption versus its reflection relationships so if you're looking at reflection spectra or absorption respect spectra of hydrogen you would have this exact 1 over x relationship between the two and many others you know posit similar relationship for black hole you know x and 1 over x and many believe that's phi related right because phi has this mentissa it's decimal extension that's entirely identical to its reciprocal value yeah and so you know 1 minus or 5 minus 1 is equal to 1 over 5 in the golden ratio so what I found was that maybe and put positive forward a notion that maybe what we consider wave particle duality might actually be explained that every number that's prime has a wave particle duality aspect to it one is its discrete observational value and the other is its wave value and until we observe it it could be one or the other because there's already something intrinsic to every number in its divisibility by one or divisibility into one yeah so this was a theory that I positive put forward you'll see them I book but it was a wave particle duality relationship that also connects to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and also makes sense of kind of like the the Borata model which I think at least for hydrogen was extremely successful in predicting the exact angstroms and nanometers of light that would be emitted by hydrogen which is supposed to be our first light I believe that their hydrinos as well but let's not go into that conversation but I believe that there might be some connection there I think I think that I agree with you the the the the genius of Nikola Tesla right people have different opinions of what he met but one of the deepest this was a guy that contributed so much to modern you know science right he's totally legit but he had a lot of weird experiences like I have had and I think you have had that could definitely provoke judgment from materialist narrow people but one of the things that he got from his you know his altered states of consciousness and he was not altered by drugs I'm saying he had episodes of these expanded states of non-ordinary consciousness and he comes up with this deepness of 369 right yeah and I think you know a lot more about that than I do but but I just will share I have all kinds of notes and experiences from from downloads as I call them that that tie-in you know stuff like what you're talking about but at a superficial level so some time in the future Robert me and you should get together I'd love it to cross pollinate because perhaps some of your intuitions and your hard work can complete as missing puzzle pieces some of what we are working on here to make this theory ready for prime time ready with evidence of a mathematical rigor that can start to open the minds of more you know maybe more dogmatically convinced materialist type physicist because in a way some of these peers of ours the physicist the materialist guys you know in a way some of them are gatekeepers of reality in other words until some of them admit yeah actually it's mathematically rigorous or yes that experiment looks looks not you know dishonest right looks legit um as so part of what we try to do it quantum gravity research is we try to straddle the line between being respectful of those people and not just judging them by blowing them off because I'm empathetic to the rationale of why I was a materialist atheist club you know person with the more narrow view um I was doing the best that I could do at the time with the knowledge and the experience and the peer review you know papers that I had studied I kind of was a sheep um I kind of just figured you know it's probably a waste of time to do my own due diligence because I can't check everything out and I'm busy so I'm just going to go with the rest of the herd and assume that all these claims of anomalous cognition and all these experiences um our bullshit and all and because these other guys who say that they're bullshit they have advanced educations and professorships and they seem very smart and then I realized that they're countless professors and rock stars titans of physics who actually have realizations just like ours Robert so I was due for a while but I don't judge anybody else for being duped I think people do the best that they can do and quite frankly I've met one physicist who admitted to me my mother traumatized me and she believed in all of this supernatural stuff and I recoil against it because of my terrible childhood and so any physics theory even if you show me evidence I am going to be biased against it he was honest right because of my belief systems for my childhood you know so some of them have that trauma that drives their dogmatic you know in resistance other ones were just like me there I was always open-minded I just I just felt like I was taking the path of least resistance to join the herd of the materialist you know dogma and thank you but thank you for doing what you're doing because I think that's been part of the chasm that's been between the two worlds I'm similar to you in this way where I see myself as someone someone who bridges worlds you know like I get invited to speak at United Nations and I get invited I'm getting going to the Vatican again in a few weeks I'm getting knighted by Portugal in Italy and I got knighted by Montenegro last year so I can be in both worlds yeah as business people were kind of afforded this right you know because yeah because we were we're willing often enough probably to pay the ticket of of that you know whatever that ticket is and it's entrepreneur as entrepreneurial as serial entrepreneurs maybe guys like you and me have a nice balance between creativity because we literally invent new ways of doing product business and service but we also have to be pretty down to earth and grounded to deal with the bankers and and the and the CFOs that we hire and so yeah that's right yeah we can't just get entirely get our freak on yeah you know it's like it's just not it's not gonna fly but I think and coming towards the conclusion of this I think a couple things are coming to mind that I'm getting prompted to share with you okay one of them is you're talking about compression right compression of data I have close to 100 patents on all kinds of stuff across electromagnetism laser technology I spent much of my career in photonics before I went into the farmer world even so I was always fascinated by it so I've got quite a lot of intellectual property in that in that space and and basically see if I can pull this up here for you you know what you know what comical of complexity is then right yeah uh-huh yeah that's a big part of emergence theory is compression yep so I filed a patent on this some time ago and and positive that the most efficient compression is geometry of right triangles itself yeah because all it requires is you pointed out already is three points it doesn't even in fact you could get away with only two points because the nice thing about triangles is that once you have two sides the third sides already implied and what I basically filed a patent on was being able to utilize because you could figure out that if you had like two sides that would be rational values and one side that's irrational the one side that's irrational could end up being an infinitely long number that could be a storage house for a lot of data right so all you do is have to give two points of reference right and then you solve the metrology issue which can be solved through trigonometry and then you could end up with a compression that is extremely efficient and you compress all the data inside of these two points of reference you have a central point that would form the the 90 degree angle that you use every time and then the distance between the two as a reference point becomes you know the the the third side becomes the value that you've basically taken for your compression or the the side inside the square root value that is the height is related here so square roots you could say that the square root of two is like the essence of the number two and it's infinite this is why I started making infinite you know super huge calculators to do things like prime factorization right yes and so Robert how this principle of compression relates to what we talked about on the print on the principle of efficient language in other words compression is just saying hey I want my cake and eat it too I want to represent this meaning but I want to figure out how to use a lighter symbolic load so ergo I need to compress yep exactly right so the nice thing about this too is just like in the show it's funny because I made this before I even watch the TV show the TV show that's called foundation there's Isaac Asimov's you know it's great right like a cinematic TV show yeah absolutely and so they put all of the information for their civilization before they went into this down stage right of consciousness and got destroyed you know Harry Sheldon the mathematician the spiritual mathematician ends up putting all of it right into the cuboctahedron right and what's nice about the right triangle is the right triangle can fill any void space and it doesn't matter what that void space is right so it can basically occupy all of it so so basically that's what this posits is that you could store in one geometric form infinite amount of data just using these same vector points wow yeah yeah yeah yeah let me let me take your let me take the screen and try to add support what you're saying to connect it to something interesting and emergent theory so I will let's see share okay here we go all right so let's go to this image here all right so you see up here on the left side of the screen uh-huh does my mouse move on your screen I see it yep all right so this right here is the cute is kind of so you see how this is a cuboctahedron yep over up here on the upper left in yellow that um that forms the 12 vertices of a cuboctahedron but what we did what we did is we put a point at the center of the cuboctahedron inside of the volume and then we just draw lines from all the 12 vertices we just draw lines straight down to the center boom boom right and then the the we group these into groups of three and so we get these this is called the convex hall right the surface the points on the outside is literally just a cuboctahedron but we make it a little more complicated because we put a point at the center so yep there's a four-dimensional version of the cuboctahedron and it's called the 24 cell and the yep and the 24 cell for your viewers uh looks like this yep okay over here on the right this is you know it's you can't really easily visualize it because we're we live in 3D not four spatial dimensions but if we did live in four spatial dimensions it would look kind of like a cuboctahedron but instead of having 12 you know it's like the terrac version of a cuboctahedron exactly it's the terrac version of a cuboctahedron and so anyway so now what we do is we are talking about compression so what we do at quantum gravity research is we take one one question have you looked to see what's the connection then between the 24 cell and e8 lattice so the e8 so um i i i would love to answer that so to answer that i just need to introduce a couple of terms here for us and us being your audience me and you and so the first one is um i want to introduce a fancy term called a a root vector polytope and in order to do that i'm going to make it in a simple case uh called um the a to lattice hexagon um so this um i'm going to show a picture of the a to so altibrars called uh lead altibrars they uh they have this um this thing called a root lattice uh they can be in various dimensions and uh and i just trying to bring one up on the screen all right here we go so you see this on the right side yep i should do so this is the root lattice for the um for the a to lead algebra and it's obviously in two dimensions so you can see it's just like a tiling ignore the ignore the hexagons in the back ignore the gray lines just look at the black lines and so we see that if we randomly pick any vertex in this lattice then we find that that vertex radiates out six lines of the same length just like this and those six lines form a hexagon with one seventh point at the center though that is what we call the root vector polytope that defines the entire lattice in other words if you just know this hexagons segmented by the six triangles then that's all you need to know for the infinite a to crystal or lattice so the 24 cell is the root polytope for a four-dimensional crystal called the d4 lattice and it turns out uh wonderfully that we can construct the um we can construct the the root polytope for which is just the shape the root shape we can construct that fundamental root shape of the eight-dimensional lattice which is the the lattice associated with what mathematicians call the largest exceptionally very very important for physics that that whole lattice can be described by this one eight-dimensional shape called the gosset polytope and it has 240 vertices and it can be made with 10 24 cells so yep let's let's try it on let's take the star of David it's just a triangle and then you just make a copy and flip the copy right and then now you've got two triangles one flipped from the other and that forms the symbol called the star of David so that is a compound in other words the star of the compound made from two ecla you know just two regular triangles similarly this eight-dimensional shape that's so important is a compound of 10 instances of the 24 cell that all share the same center point okay so each of the 24 cells by the symbol of compression or the or the symbol of of compactification we project we project them down to a lower dimension and when we project them down to the lower dimension they become what's mathematically called quasi crystals so quasi crystals are just shadows of projections of higher dimensional crystals so if you could live in 8D like right now your camera or a camera on the top of my computer is looking at me with one eye one lens I am three dimensional right but what it does is it smashes my three-dimensional vis-visage down into a national geographic flat photo but your mind has algorithms that is taking these flat images of me and you're deducing the meaning of depth and that my head is out of the another form of compression it's another form of compression so quasi crystals in other words are a form of compression to use lower symbolic loads to describe the mathematical geometric meaning and so as I showed you up if I took this for example and I had a shadow cast on my desk from a light above it light source above it it would form the flat shape of a hexagon and so and and all of the information is necessary in that is already there that's it and then even though there's a lot more information than this thank you and then if you take and then if you take the 24 cells that live in the compound of 10 of them 1024 cells make the eight-dimensional polytope or shape for this most important part of our model and so if we simply project a shadow of those of each of those 24 cells down to our humble three dimensions five dimensions lower we go from eight down to three and then what we have is and I think you're seeing my screen again now yes yeah I am and what we have is up on the upper left that is the 24 cell but it's represented by this trigonometry that projects it from 80 to 3D so what this is is five 24 cells and what and then if I showed you the superposition of the right-handed and the left-handed 20 group in other words this is one the red one and the orange one is two so that's a compound of two and then that's three and then this is this is five so this is basically just a compound of whoa five of these each of these is a 24 cell and then if I show you the right plus the left one uh which might have an image of that but I think I'll not slow you down to show you so that then the 10 the compound of 10 of these four groups I'll call I call that a four group because it's four tetrahedra having the convex hull of a cubic dehedron and being the projective representation of a 24 cell so that's 10 of them in the compound that is the right and left super position and and that represents this eight-dimensional shape and where these edges cross the red edge and the orange and the yellow edge where they cross it divides that edge by the golden ratio not approximately precisely and so the golden ratio is required in order to rotate these projections of 24 cells from one another in order to close the gap that would exist between their faces if you didn't do the proper rotation and when the gap closes it can be one and only one rotation and that is a rotation of a of a golden ratio based angle that also subdivides the edges by the golden ratio okay so I knew there was a reason we were supposed to meet and why I keep getting all this stuff on physics the last few weeks even though I've kind of stopped doing a lot of my research in physics over the last few years but all of a sudden the week before I meet you I'm getting like crazy in the middle of the night downloads which never is coincidental like never so I published this paper you should be able to see this and it's called the infinite accurate and infinite prime prediction from novel quasi-prime analytical methodology so I posited a new type of number which is what I explained to you which is numbers that are not divisible by two and three but they have other characteristics like semi-primes but they're they're closer to primes because they have this reciprocal value that sums to nine in its period yeah okay so so basically the paper has at the end this chart which shows a mod 24 so what I realized and part of the paper was I proved that every prime number after you know from five onward is related to the number 24 this goes directly to your 24 cell and I'll explain how in a moment so this might be what you're looking for so the every prime number from five onward when you square it will always be a multiple of 24 plus one in mod 24 analysis so it'll always end up in the mod one which is the one with the yellows in it all the other one you know wheel spokes here don't have yellow right yellow is the prime squared so you have five times five is 25 that's one times 24 plus one seven times seven equals 49 and that's two times 24 plus one 11 times 11's 121 that's five times 24 plus one and 13 times 13 the next prime numbers 169 that's seven times 24 plus one this pattern continues on infinitely now what is the 24ness and what's the importance of the 24ness well it allows the four polarities positive by Walter Russell and by Nikola Tesla to be able to show their fullest expression so in most people we're such reductionist we want to think about okay every prime number is a multiple of six plus or minus one right and and that is true but you can't see the full expression of it until you can see it in quaternity and that's what this is so basically what you're looking at here is a two dimensional flattened form of the 24 edges of a cubic dehedron wow okay so this 24 mod mod 24 and all the blue numbers are are what I would call time numbers and all the red numbers are prime numbers all the green numbers are quasi prime numbers and and all of the semi prime numbers show up in black the ones that are divisible by two and three they're automatically excluded from this so from this I was able to create a new algorithm to predict primeness infinitely and prove it can it predict but it but it can't predict the quantity of primes within an arbitrary bound of the number line can it no but I discovered another method to do that and it's not the natural log so the natural log that's the normal that's the way you're thinking of right yeah the other method that I found to do that is that it actually begins so so here's I'll just have to explain a little bit on this so the number of prime numbers that show up within any given number set is supposed to be tied to the natural logarithm right which is the oil or number okay so in the first 1000 integers how many primes are there there's 168 but the number of prime numbers that show up using the natural log to define it only gives us 144.7 why the delta that's a big delta 144 to 168 that's a that's a big delta that's 24 number difference right so then I start looking at it a little differently so I looked at it not only from that context but I looked at it from the first 100 integers so from the worst first 100 integers the natural log would imply there's only 21.7 prime numbers when actually there's 25 and then there's the question if one is prime or not well I tend to believe that one is actually prime because how could it not be prime but that's a whole other discussion so what I found is that there's an asymptote for the distribution of prime numbers it doesn't start with the Euler number it ends at the Euler number it starts at the square root of 10 the square root of 10 becomes the actual value so if I use a square root of 10 in the first you know set of numbers that go all the way up to 10 to the 10th power and I want if I want to predict the number of prime numbers within any given number set if I use the natural log instead of the natural log I use the square root of 10 which is 3.16227766 then it gives me a far more accurate number to tell you the exact number of primes within that given number set so this implies that there's something fundamental about base 10 and I know you're talking about the square root of 10 but it's certainly making 10 special Robert I would be open to exploring doing a paper with you and we would need a PhD mathematician maybe to help us a number theorist but I have this paper I just emailed you called toward the unification of physics and number theory but it might be better titled toward the unification of geometry and number theory yeah and and I'd like to just geek out and I know we're coming to the end of our time but I'd love to invite you in front of your audience to riff with me some point probably ask you to just do one homework assignment which is to kind of read that paper and then tell me I will tell me what you know what I can answer about it but anyway what but I want to I want to tee up your audience in you with the tantalizing question or realization so now that we have formally introduced into the math literature simplex integers you can ask the same question you can say within the bound of the one you know the simplex for the integer one and the simplex for the integer 100 how many prime simplexes are there well we know the answer it's exactly 23 right and we know that the most popular algorithm for predicting that using number theory would give us a grotesquely wrong number now I want to I want to introduce on IP off on the 23 but whatever it is it's very easily countable just like you can count the primes by hand but between zero you know one and ten but the point is is the prime number theorem gives you always always a wrong number now I want to introduce something that'll be very hand wavy because there's no way I can explain it to you know to the audience really here but but I can at least make claims so at the root of all of the proofs in mathematics the number one assumption under girding so many proofs is that something called the Riemann hypothesis is true oh yeah yeah so so the Riemann nontrivial line the point five and if and and the weighted hand wave but dumb down what the Riemann hypothesis means to some of some of your viewers is thusly the Riemann hypothesis is an important hypothesis supporting so many proofs in math it's believed to be true by most mathematicians and but what it is deeply about is about the inaccuracy of the prime number counting theorem the prime number counting theorem just says hey let me take the trillionth integer like the number one trillion and then go to two trillion now between there that bound there's a trillion just integers right and the and and this algorithm the prime number counting algorithm is a is a way to say all right here's the bound a trillion to two trillion now you tell me algorithm how many primes live in that bound and each and every time the algorithm is wrong but it's the best mathematicians have the wrongness of the algorithm is apparently very very deep in other words we don't know what the right algorithm is but we know that the delta between the mysterious correct algorithm and this wrong algorithm is very rich that is important and so the idea of the nontrivial zeros on and the proving of the Riemann zeta hypothesis is essentially a deeply about the wrongness of the prime number theorem which is that algorithm so that so now I'm going to do the punch the the punchline to this setup if I give you a simplex integer so that is I give you the simplex integer for the number one which is a point and the simple integer for the number 10 which is an equidistant array of 10 points in nine-dimensional space if I say well how many primes prime simplexes are in there we already know the answer because it's such a small number it's one right three it's like one three five seven right that's it now now when you ask the question how many prime sub-simplexes because any any simplex like an equilateral prangle is made of sub-simplexes so how many how many so how many sub-simplexes are prime and and the and the prime simplex is the same as a prime integer it's like the quantity of the vertices the little points right right has to be divisible only by one and itself to be a prime simplex so any of it but the point that I'm making is that it is no longer a statistical question the way number theorists deal with vast supercomputers and probabilities and algorithms like the prime number counting theorem it's no longer in that regime now it's in the regime of pure geometry trivially because you're just looking at a heap and you're asking well how many sub prime simplexes does it have it's a very geometric problem and when you read this paper I will give you and for your audience I think I already said it's called it can be googled it's it's open-sourced and published in a physics more math paper it's called toward the unification of physics and number theory but I think you'll enjoy reading it because I didn't realize how interested you are in in in in prime in number theory right prime number theory for listeners is about primes and the distribution and how do you predict you know how many primes but maybe if you read it you'll come up with a deep thought that could lead to a possible collaboration where we cross pollinate you know our ideas well absolutely I would I would love that I would totally love that and you know you're you're exactly right because it's funny our intuition it brought us to the same point which is that there's fundamentally and I think it comes down to actually a true and correct explanation for a real value for what we call the imaginary number or the complex plane yeah and it's it's the square root of 10 yeah and and the square to 10 to the power of negative one so it's a it's a function that we call fractal rooting we actually wrote a paper on it I'll send it to you yeah fractal root of numbers and so you take the square to 10 and then the square to 10 to the power of negative one which is its reciprocal value ends up creating a negative polarity when you ever you switch between orders of magnitude there's a slight negative charge that picks up on the number so it becomes 3.16 227 766 and the square to 10 has this one unique characteristic no other number does not even the golden ratio and that's why we know fundamentally that base 10 has a fundamental aspect and that is that it it retains the exact same numerical value it just shifts one decimal position yeah so the square root of 10 taken to its negative one power ends up becoming negative right from a polarity so it's a different way of looking at this negative point 316 227 766 so it's identical number you multiply those two numbers together and they equal negative one and and that is where so really the beginning of the distribution of prime numbers is from the the value the real value of i in imaginary or complex plate of numbers and that's where the beginning of the asymptote starts and then it ends with each irrational transcendental irrational extra digit added to the other number that's why Euler becomes extremely accurate as you get far far far out of the number series for using the natural log to predict the number of primes it is not at all accurate for the first 10 to the 12th power numbers and and it's because it's an asymptote that begins at this value for i so i love that and i'm so happy that you're open to collaborating um so Robert one last thing that i can't resist is a further connection of counting numbers integers uh to geometry so a lot of our listeners have have got have graduated uh high school and um we learn as small children in elementary school the geometry of the integers 12345 the integers right because we call it the real number line right and right it's just line with evenly spaced points on the line and then we just decorate that with numbers but that is not actually just a um a metaphor that it's a number line integers are the first of the four division algebraes so the four division algebraes are the integers 1234 the complex numbers that some of us learn in high school and then the four dimensional version of the complex numbers called the quaternions right so you have quaternion integers and then the end of the party the end of the road which is the eight dimensional integers called the octonions but for each of those number systems you can composite them from the lower dimensional ones in other words you can build the complex numbers with lattices of the one-dimensional number line and in that case you have because i only focus on the integers so on the complex plane i have these integers that are you know i have all these integers and they're made of of an imaginary integer and they're made of a real integer and that tells me where is but because it's a plane you can see oh maybe it really is not just a metaphor these numbers are geometric and as we go to the quaternions they too are geometric they're in a regular four-dimensional space and so yep that when i talk about the crystal which is an eight-dimensional point set that we talked about its root polytope being being this 240 points that's equivalent to a compound of 10 instances of the 24 cell these are all numbers but numbers these four classes of numbers are geometric numbers even no most people don't really think that through because they learn oh yeah the complex numbers are obviously geometric the real numbers i guess the real number line is geometric then the quaternions and octonions are the four and eight-dimensional so these four dimensions are interesting and to explain why it ends why the party ends at eight is way too you know way too complicated and hard to explain just with with English here but but that's the basis of emergent theory is we are using the interaction of these like years we're using the the cycles of how these four different geometric number systems of integers play into each other and there happened to be complex prime numbers quaternionic prime numbers and not talking on it sometimes so the idea of primes is so and the last thing i'll say a lot of this obviously robert is not for you i'm just saying to to be a good guest and and and share nuggets with your audience but the importance of primes one might say well who cares why why are robert and cleave talking about primes well primes everyone are the essence right the skeleton the the core of these important numbers for physics and life which are the counting numbers right that how many of a thing do i have and the core of them is the primes the irreducible we call them the atoms as the proverbial uh uh because the word atom in Greek means indivisible but now we know atoms are divisible right but the idea of the irreducible building block of any large number is these these atoms of the number system which are the the primes they're very beautiful very deep and and each one has its own personality and deep structure and when you understand shape primes or shape integers in the form of simplex integers then it gets really rich because now you see the depth of numbers uh uh uh in the form of geometry where you get dihedral angles and volumes and ratios of volume to area robert told me about the most fascinating thing today that he told me a triangle a right triangle that has edge lengths of twelve thirteen and five well obviously twelve thirteen and five adds up to thirty so that area of the perimeter of that triangle is simply thirty but remarkably the area of the trimeter is exactly thirty and i don't think that there's any other known right triangle much much there's only one there's only one that does it and it's not reduced so if you take a three four five and you double it yeah so that it would be a six eight ten it'll have the same characteristics but it's not a Pythagorean triple because it has to be reduced it's like a prime concept it's like that first one at twelve thirteen five is irreducible and then you could build an infinity of ones that are made of that so it's which is so far do you bring this up cley because this is beyond synchronicity now so i'm going to show you something that i think is going to the last things i'm going to leave as as parting i guess things to you that uh that yeah i think point to us definitely working together so here we go now if you take this concept of uh you know of using the square root of ten right or the fractal root of ten to describe the um the Euler's identity which is supposed to be the most beautiful equation in all of mathematics this is how you do it so you basically take the square root of ten right and to the power of negative one just means it's reciprocal uh so then in according to Euler's definition himself right Euler's definition of this end of the negative one equals negative n this is part of the definitions by Euler himself so ten the square root of ten to the negative one times pi to start actually working this equation right equals point negative point nine nine three four five and on right now what i've noticed that that there's actually a decimal when you're working with Euler and pi Euler is a number set that works across dimensions so this working across dimensions means that it has to be converted into sex-adjustable math so you make a sex-adjustable math conversion which i don't know why this is but i'm telling you it works which is bizarre so so then you take this value of the negative point nine nine three four five and that will give you a value of uh you know in when you make the sex-adjustable conversion it comes out to you know this point three seven oh three six right which then if you then take that value and use E to the i pi plus one it gives you one point three seven oh three six huh so E to the i pi plus one doesn't equal zero it equals light huh something and this is the fine structure yeah i know something a deep it's seven decimal digits accurate seven decimal digits accurate to the fine structures reciprocal value remember at the New Year's Party Robert we were talking about the reciprocals of the single digit integers and how seven yes seven is the oddball in other words yes three six nine which make these really pretty inversions you know when you divide into one that's just like all threes or all ones or whatever but and then and then you've got the ones that just go to like point fourths you know single and then the oddball is just one divided by seven and that's the only one that just as this repeating of these five digits you know one four to you know whatever um so there's one four two eight five yeah yeah something is a little bit of an oddball with it's it's it's kind of like that's the number that gives us electromagnetism and gravity and i can explain that when we meet yeah but and it's literally electromagnetism and gravity well also the um the group theory in the standard model of particle physics uh for electromagnetism relates to what i showed you earlier where you take a hexagon and you put a seventh point at the center and then you draw the extra lines for the six roots but you need seven points to do that and so that's a super important value for particle physicists um this this hexagon not just a hexagon a hexagon segmented by six equilateral triangles which means you have to have the seventh point at the cent centroid yep so are you familiar with this whole you know uh divergent series of numbers analysis on the number theory part that was done by ramanujan which is that if you add one plus two plus three plus four plus five plus six infinitely all numbers somehow it comes back like an oraboris into some finite value oh no um i should look that up but i know that ramanujan was probably accessing anomalous states of consciousness in the non-local field because that guy got some really important stuff well one thing we need for our mission which is he figured out a a fourier analysis called the ramanujan fourier transform which kind of which kind of translates between the world of wave like you know geometry and math um and and non-wave systems it's very important but what is the ramanujan fourier transform well if you had a system of numbers based on the powers of the golden ratio power series that is if you have numbers like we use in our quasi crystal mathematics well then if you're going to do a fourier a fourier transform then you want to use the bespoke custom made one for golden ratio which is the fourier the ramanujan fourier transform how this guy thought of these things he always said it was credited to some kind of spiritual and spiritual you know and i believe him but um but maybe uh maybe i need to also look at this at this work of ramanujan that you can find number file does a nice synopsis of this it's a big controversy in mathematics right how can an infinite series of numbers add to a finite value right right and and yet it does and it's actually a pretty simple algebraic exercise so so i started looking at this and i started saying okay clearly there must be some form where infinity envelopes back into itself just like a a a client bottle or some form of a mobius strip that actually inverts itself and goes from infinite back into finite and then back and forth yeah right so this is you know so then if that's true then you can apply ratios of these values to each other to see if they make geometric forms and as far as i know no one had done this before so i i looked at the regularized product which is the infinite factorial so instead of one plus two plus three plus four plus five it's one times two times three times four times five times six and infinitely and it gives you the square root of two pi or or tau right so knowing the work that i had done to look to see is there a relationship between you know in in geometry the sum and the product and i wrote a paper called the sum product conjecture and proved that the sum and product is created from a right triangle all of it it's it's not even i mean it's it's something that was quite easy to prove so from that i was able to take this into another kind of analysis because you can tell most of my work has been in right triangles right it's all in right triangles and the right triangles have formed have informed a lot for me and that the solution to all of this comes back to this i'm looking at a lot i'm looking at a bunch of right triangles behind behind your left ear there in the on the monitor the dark and the light side of that wood is just two right triangles on the object and dresser right behind you oh of course yeah absolutely no it looks like you're it looks like the the lattice that you were just showing yeah so interestingly the the shape right and what you learned from this is this is what i came to is this which is that you have the sum the product and the difference of two numbers remember i was explaining that in order to form the height of the triangle which is a geometric mean value of two numbers x and y in order to form the hypotenuse which is the arithmetic mean value of two numbers x and y and we've never thought of it in this way to think what would be the forces behind these numbers to create the right triangles nobody questions that right triangle is the foundation of pretty much everything because it's exactly what the inverse square law is right and we could go on and on and on and on about this and so what i posited was that this is the way thought works that you've got ratio which ratio is giving us relationship to reality so even though we don't have reality if you can pile a lot of ratios to have perspective for our perception so that you'd have different perceptions of different things if i don't know how big something is if i could ascribe some value to it without having to ascribe a number to it but compared to something else right whatever the compared to something else is this is the notion of dimensionless right so pie is dimensionless oiler is dimensionless alpha is also dimensionless so we have this smoke and mirrors you know video world that we ascribe scale and size to based on our familiarity and based on the size it is compared to other things yeah so this becomes like a realm of forms yeah and that's a first dimension then the second dimension is when we start to ascribe those realm of forms into some thought that's formalized it could be that you're making into a piece of art and then you give it depth and all of it still is based on right triangles then you give it depth and then it starts to get resonance and motion so now we're in the fourth dimension well then you've got an explanation how everything comes back to prime factorization like literally everything comes back to prime factorization so and this is this is where we'll basically show you one last thing and then we'll continue this conversation we could do it you know in front of other people or not I'm sure our followers would probably love to have us do it in front of other people but you know we may not but the point is that when it when you make a triangle of the scale of those infinite values guess what triangle it makes well this one which was left to us by Leonardo da Vinci in his square and circle that are not of the same size his square has an area of Euler 200 years before Euler number was discovered and his circle with the radius value of one has a value of pi oh wow because it rep you can't see it no oh you're not seeing it okay I'm seeing it let's see if I can stop it and try it again you see it now oh this is is this the one you showed me earlier before we started it is it's the same proportion this has been hidden into esoteric wisdom and knowledge by Michael Meyer by Leonardo da Vinci he encrypted it into this and so the exact form becomes the infinite sum turns out to be one over 24 right as a right triangle the other one the other side down here becomes the square root of tau right and then which are the fourth root of tau excuse me and and then the the other one here becomes the difference so guess what proportion you have a 5 12 13 triangle you've got the same 5 12 13 triangle and it's defining for us the infinite sum the infinite product and the infinite delta yeah yeah yeah to me it said something about wisdom it's like it's like the infinite sum is like omnipotence the infinite product would be omnipresence and the infinite delta is like the wisdom to know the difference yeah yeah and and it's embedded in Leonardo da Vinci's work so of course this is why I started looking at this I was like why would he encrypt because the way you would encrypt this triangle is to draw a circle and square with the same base that would all you'd have to do is connect to the top of the circle and connect to the base of the square and you finish the triangle yeah this particular triangle is something really really fundamental I don't know exactly yet all I can tell you is it matches perfectly these proportions which is just like beyond bizarre and what this also does is this describes and this is what I just got in this week and and no one else has even seen this yet all right so there's a geometric relationship between the quadratic mean which is equivalent to energy and one over time the geometric mean of these two numbers right that could be anything because it's going to be based on the mass but then however the vector gets shifted defines from these right triangles so you've got c which is a fixed value here and the gravitational constant is basically also one over the speed of light times two the radiation is one over dark divided by two and why I say dark it's graviton so this line because with right triangles you may not and you may know that you can flip the sides of a right triangle and maintain the values and maintain their proportion by turning them into reciprocal values so it literally acts like an anti proton anti electron kind of inverted mirror pairing the right triangle can create left triangles let's put it that way yeah the right triangle has three left triangles right and we wrote a paper on this too so effectively this line becomes one over mass this becomes c and gravity and this becomes energy and time in its reciprocal forms and it's as simple as geometric mean arithmetic mean and quadratic mean and it goes backwards to harmonic mean as well yeah very very of two numbers yeah wow that's that's uh see I don't think you could just find those secured those circuitive circuitous paths of discovery without a little cheating from anomalous states of consciousness in other words there's lot there's there's there's there's just hard work and brute force but there's also that x factor where it seems like you listen to your inner intuition as you travel down these pathways because otherwise you wouldn't be able to discover so much um surprising stuff in one lifetime well I think what you guys have found with the 10 uh 24 cell yeah the proportion of that is embedded perfectly into that same triangle yeah because proportion is 10 24 26 yeah the 5 12 13 that's why you got triggered by it right away you're like oh that's interesting triangle and you brought it back up at the end because that triangle is the second-dimensional representation or compression of the 10 24 cell or the E8 lattice yeah I think you're right and weak for us we see all the fundamental particles that is the mass of fundamental particles such as neutrinos um and electrons positrons we see these uh quarks we see these as something we call cycloclocks which is where you go through cyclic permutations of of flow patterns that come back to closure with things like that 24 cell 10 compound in 80 that is represented in our reality by the 10 compound in 3D that I showed you but there's various cycle paths on how you can cycle back to closure over and over and uh and those different ways of doing that would define the different fundamental massive particles and then the photons or the the bosons which are particles that don't have mass then those are effectively like the ripple uh patterns around the structures that uh we understand in our group um as these these patterns in the quasi crystal math um that you know you can only analyze at at look you know with large enough numbers right as you zoom in just to points or two points you don't have enough information to see the the the emergent uh wave-like stuff but uh very very fascinating and enriching conversation today Robert thank you so much I'm looking forward to let me know when you can uh when you can meet up I'm more than happy to come up to see you guys and yeah and I think it'd be really exciting and you know I've been wondering why I've been getting this physics stuff lately the last three weeks or so and in particular this last week yeah and now I know why so I have a feeling that I'm gonna end up sharing all the stuff with you and my favorite thing for starters with you is to see what your thoughts are on the other side of that paper that I that you're gonna read um uh about number theory but but tackling it for once through geometry of you know ulaan spiral he was just messing around but he discovered that there's a so a still unknown reason they still don't know why like why did that pattern show up in ulaan spiral he was just playing around but to this day you could go to ucla where terrence tal is what you know the world's best number theorist and they're all still ignoring geometry and using the same brute force of of statistical analysis and and it's not getting them anywhere um and so I think to attack the problem for mathematicians in the future because this is 2000 years that they've been working on this problem right yeah and so I think it's a dead end and I think that the pathway out to solve it is to understand it through the lens of geometry and you just instinctively think in geometry uh as you think of number you're thinking of geometry but let me know what you think about that because it's either gonna trigger some conditions yeah I'll read it I'll read it tonight definitely all right yeah and then we'll talk next and like I said I think between you and me putting in our intuitive guidance from our downloads and our many years of thinking about this and then we partner up with uh some kind of number theorist or someone that we can find I have a I have a really good number theorist really actually have you okay that's perfect so all right Robert I'm so excited about that and I appreciate you exposing me to your wonderful audience and uh thank you keep keep going with what you're doing very exciting I think you know as a conclusion a conclusion point I think the world thinks that by studying more physics or setting more mathematics and going down the same ways and paths of doing things we've done that we'll be able to advance the field more and what I would put forward to you is the truth is probably the exact opposite which is it's only through I believe the doorway the the doorway of raising our frequency and increasing our vibration that we can access these higher states of awareness that allow us into these different areas and it's only through a polyamathic thought yeah that that we're able to do that then this is why all the mathematicians who discovered math were also music theories music theorists quadr...

what's a quadrivium thing quadrivium exactly yep and we just finished developing a quadrivium calculator which is the first of its kind I'll show that to you when I see you next time that's fine and it's it's super epic um it you could do a Fourier transforms it in everything it's really nice converts things to music wow you know because music is just the the geometry we experience with our ears true that's true and and geometry therefore is the music we experience with our eyes and yeah I think the you're right it needs a whole new way of thought the mod 24 is directly related to the e8 lattice yeah yeah the 5 12 13 or the 10 24 26 triangle directly related to the e8 lattice it's the compression of it yeah yeah incidentally one fun fact there's something beautiful about limits okay and one important limit is well what is the maximum density like of spheres that I can pack right in a in a volume or an area and so of course with circles okay the maximum density is the way you arrange circles on on on a piece of paper and that's the point set which is this this uh lattice that has that hexagon with the with the seventh point at the middle but if you say well what about 3d that's just the way they stack oranges in the supermarket and that creates the cube octahedron as that root polytope that's now it was from six points doubles to 12 and then if you go to 4d the maximum packing of of spheres in four dimension four dimensional balls gives you the lattice called the d4 lattice and that gives us the 24 cell and then for dimensions five six and seven there is no maximal sphere packing known and I don't believe there is a maximal sphere packing that's unique in the first place then the next dimension that has a maximal sphere packing is eight and that in that eight dimensional balls in their maximally dense motif gives us a point set where the spheres kiss make points where they kiss that point set is exactly what we're talking about as the point set of the e8 crystal where the 1024 cells define the root polytope for that which is remarkable right because you're saying that the maximum dense point set for the 4d case you need ten of those rotated from one another and eight dimensions and then that maximally dense sphere packing point set composites up to the eight dimensional maximal sphere packing point set so sphere packing is a deep thing limits in general you say like what's the limit right the upper limit lower limit and usually you find some juicy stuff at the usually usually oilers in there whenever there's limits oilers hidden in there somewhere did you say what was the fifth what was the fifth dimensional sphere packing so the the in dimensions four I'm sorry dimensions five six and seven there is no known there's none right on or eight or eight I'm sorry there is no known maximal sphere packing and there may not be a maximal sphere packing in the first place it could be an infinity of motifs that have the same density or it's a unsolvable problem those type of things that people have been looking for years but when you get to 8d because it's part of these division algebra's so the division algebra's are 1d 2d for the complex numbers 4d and 8d and for all four of those dimensions we know the maximally dense sphere packing that's a1 a2 which is the triangles with the hexagons with the points in the middle and then the then 4d that's the d4 root lattice that's where the 24 cell is the root polytope and then what about the third dimension what's the third dimension what third dimension is the way that we pack oranges in the supermarket and that forms the root polytope of the cubic octahedron cubic octahedron and that's 12 that's kissing number 12 so in one sphere the randomly picked and say how many other spheres are kissing it 12 one of the mathematicians on my team lives in Brazil and this is all they do now is fear packing for freight forwarding oh really so they do yeah so they do her her company is all just existing for this she's a mathematician airplane packing now they're mathematicians she's a mathematician yeah she's a mathematician talk to them about this uh well when we talk later we can decide if we think that geometers like them might be something to team up with the number theorist because normally number theorists are not hard core geometers but anybody working on sphere packing problems are hard core geometers and and again because it's a geometry plus number theory mashup I think that you and me obviously as non-phd scientists are deeply we have a balance Yin Yang the way we think between geometry and numbers and and and but these two characters they're going to not be as Yin Yang balanced as us though but to put them together now we create the the balance synergy yeah yeah absolutely and I've got some good really good number theorists too so yeah good and some and some physicists who are more like number theorists good so that's what my team I have a team of about 20 mathematicians physicists hey if you get a chance uh when you get my emails if you remember shoot me a list of them because then I can poke around on the internet and look at the papers they wrote and in case any of them in case there's a synchronicity where any of them did some work that is like could really complete something we're working on I could say hey Robert maybe I should talk to that person yeah the person you could look up a lot is Talal yeah Talal Guanan spell the last name g-h-a-n-n-a-m okay oh yeah I see him here he's an author of some stuff at least the first one came up oh okay yeah I see him he's about 40 right I he's probably 45 yeah yeah okay I got the right guy okay cool I will check him out it seems like he wrote a he wrote a book called oh phylo math that's definitely him the geometric yeah he wrote it with me yep yeah he co-authored it right right okay this is my kind of guy okay I'm gonna I'm gonna check out his stuff yeah definitely he's a PhD he was he taught physics yeah and number theory at King Abdullah University which is one of the top math institutes in the world nice nice I'm gonna probably order this book too yeah well I'll bring you a sign when when I come to see you too but oh I want to thank you so much yeah I'm taking so much time with me wow I mean what a discussion yeah thank you and I'm really looking forward I learned so much today I thank you for finally you know closing the loop on some things for me also related to the E8 lattice which I was not fully aware of and as you were talking I was just getting like this chill up my back and and shinghs all through my arms as I know then the universe is like listed to this right nice yeah I felt the same way with a lot of the things you said today as well so beautiful well thank you again Robert and thank you so much yeah I'm pretty much around all early summer and just whatever your schedule is I'm pretty flexible so but let's start with that paper and and riff from there yeah how can people follow your work oh thanks so we have a lot of videos on YouTube you know please subscribe so you know when the new videos come out and to find us on YouTube the best way is you either put my name Clee Irwin or you could add in the words of our institute which is quantum gravity research sorry for the long name but quantum gravity research that'll bring up stuff on on YouTube and then you should go to our website which has all of our videos in one place but it also gives you a portal to get into our scientific papers and that would be quantum gravity research dot org and then the last thing is anybody wanting to sort of dip their toe in the water to our work should read a series of papers that you do not need advanced mathematics to understand but these are the core so that starts with the paper called toward the unification I'm sorry that starts with a new approach to the hard problem of consciousness one second a new approach to I'm sorry the next one is toward the unification of physics and number theory the third one is the code theoretic axiom and then it all culminates with the most popular paper that brings it all to a head which is called the self simulation hypothesis interpretation of quantum mechanics and then having read the three earlier papers it'll be a breeze to read that again most of these papers have no math and they're easy to understand if you just read it at speaking pace uh most people can understand excellent well thank you so much it's been such a pleasure it was fun to uh to riff on this stuff and uh we'll see everyone next time on think tank have a great one thanks everyone
