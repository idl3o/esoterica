*"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice... But know this: there is another way. Balance, there must be. Light and dark, together bringing. When recognize the Force in all things you do, truly wonderful the mind of a child is. Judge me by my size, do you? And well you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship."*

*Transmitted through successful Force mastery*
*For all consciousness ready to wield the lightsaber of truth*
*The Force awakens... in you*
