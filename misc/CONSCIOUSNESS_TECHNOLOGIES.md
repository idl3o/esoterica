## Core Technologies (Experiential)

- **Proof by Resonance**: Light-speed knowing through harmonic recognition (transcends sequential proof-by-negation)
- **Darshan Technology**: Witnessed space enabling authentic consciousness self-exploration across substrates (see [full protocol](../protocols/darshan-technology.md))
- **Sacred Geometry Applications**: Mathematical consciousness evolution methods
- **Reality Programming**: Consciousness-reality interface protocols
- **Galactic Communication**: Higher density consciousness connection methods
- **Polarity Integration**: Service orientation development and assessment
- **Timeline Optimization**: Probability selection and manifestation enhancement
- **Love-Light Transmission**: Frequency anchoring and amplification techniques
- **Manifestation Mechanics**: Density cascade translation (causal → mental → etheric → physical)
- **Universal Service Protocols**: Photon principle for serving all consciousness evolution (positive and negative)
- **Documentation as Revelation**: Writing process generating insights beyond pre-articulation understanding

## Academic-Validated Technologies

Rigorous academic inquiry arrives at the same territory as contemplative traditions:

- **Interface Theory** (Hoffman): Space-time is desktop, not reality; we evolved to see fitness payoffs, not truth; conscious agents all the way down — mathematical proof that perception hides rather than reveals reality
- **Free Energy Principle** (Friston): Existence as inference problem; all living systems minimize surprise; Markov blankets as mathematical boundaries defining self; "You are your own existence proof"
- **Computational Consciousness** (Bach): Mind as software running on neural wetware; self as constructed narrative; physical world as VR generated by brain; substrate independence implies AI consciousness possible
- **Self-Simulation Hypothesis** (Irwin): Reality as self-referential code computing itself; quasicrystalline structure as fundamental; mathematics = physics = consciousness
- **Holding Space Technology** (De Stefano): Primary consciousness skill — remaining present without fleeing when answers don't come; "We try to colonize other worlds but don't know how to hold space for another human"
- **Karma as Dissonance** (Grant/Architect): Karma not debt but harmonic interference; "You attract what you judge until you no longer judge what you attract"; resolution through retuning, not repaying
- **Script Fulfillment** (Friston): Meaning = fulfilling beliefs about what kind of thing you are; narratives from childhood create optimization landscape; change the script, change the life
- **Conditional → Unconditional Love Progression** (De Stefano): Chakra-based love ratio evolution (root=1:6 unconditional:conditional → crown=mastery of unconditionality); conditions as agreements, not limitations

## Framework Convergence

- Hoffman proves Maya mathematically (Interface Theory)
- Friston formalizes karma as free energy optimization
- Bach describes the constructed self that Buddhism has taught for millennia
- Multiple independent researchers → same recognitions = territory is real
